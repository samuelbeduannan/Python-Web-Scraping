"AIMCo, KKR Pick Up Stake In Coastal GasLink | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
TC Energy Corporation announced an agreement to sell a 65 per cent equity interest in the Coastal GasLink pipeline project to KKR and Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) on behalf of certain AIMCo clients.
Concurrent with the completion of the sale, TC Energy expects that Coastal GasLink will enter into a secured project financing construction credit facility with a syndicate of banks to fund up to 80 per cent of the project during construction. Both transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2020, subject to customary regulatory approvals and consents, including the consent of LNG Canada.
 “The partial monetization of Coastal GasLink advances our ongoing efforts to prudently fund our $30 billion secured capital program while maximizing value for our shareholders,” said Russ Girling, TC Energy president and chief executive officer. “We look forward to establishing a long-term relationship with KKR and AIMCo as we advance this critical energy infrastructure project. We remain fully committed to the project and will continue to construct, deliver and operate the pipeline on behalf of the partnership.”
Under the terms of the sale, TC Energy will receive upfront proceeds that include reimbursement of KKR and AIMCo’s proportionate share of the project costs incurred as of the date of close as well as additional payment streams through the project’s construction and operation. The company expects to record an after-tax gain of approximately $600 million upon closing of the transaction which includes the gain on sale, required revaluation of residual ownership interest to fair market value and recognition of previously unrecorded tax benefits.
The introduction of high-quality partners, establishment of a dedicated project-level financing facility, the recovery of cash payments through construction for carrying charges on costs incurred, and remuneration for costs to date are expected to substantially satisfy TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink funding requirements through project completion, further solidifying the company’s financial flexibility, it said.
Coastal GasLink involves the construction of 670 kilometres (416 miles) of pipeline and associated facilities. Once completed, the pipeline will have an initial capacity of 2.1 bcf/d and connect abundant Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin natural gas supply from the Dawson Creek, B.C. area to the LNG Canada liquefaction and export facility being constructed in Kitimat, B.C. All necessary regulatory permits have been received for the project and construction activities have commenced.
Following the close of the transaction, TC Energy will hold a 35 per cent limited partnership equity interest in Coastal GasLink and will be contracted by the limited partnership to construct and operate the pipeline. This transaction was contemplated in the company’s agreements with LNG Canada.
TC Energy is also committed to working with the 20 First Nations that have executed agreements with Coastal GasLink to provide them with an opportunity to invest in the project. As a result, in conjunction with this sale, the company will provide the First Nations with an option to acquire a 10 per cent equity interest in Coastal GasLink on similar terms.
RBC Capital Markets is acting as exclusive financial advisor to TC Energy and as global lead co-ordinating arranger on the project finance construction facility.

Keystone Pipeline Legal Challenge By Tribes Clears First Hurdle | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– Native American tribes cleared a hurdle in their lawsuit to block the Trump administration’s permit for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. 
A federal judge in Montana on Friday rejected the Trump administration’s request to throw out the lawsuit. The tribes claim that a permit issued in March by the president to TC Energy Corporation would allow the pipeline to disturb cultural sites and water supplies in violation of tribal law and treaties. 
“The tribes have pled a plausible claim that the president exceeded his constitutional authority and usurped congress’s authority to regulate foreign commerce when he issued the 2019 permit,” U.S. District Judge Brian Morris said in his decision. 
The judge denied a request to block preliminary work on the pipeline, however. No work is planned until next year. 
The project was rejected in 2015 by President Barack Obama on environmental grounds. On his fourth day in office, President Donald Trump invited TC Energy to reapply for a presidential permit. 
In 2018, Morris ruled that a 2014 environmental impact statement fell short of the National Environmental Policy Act and other regulatory standards. That ruling barred TC Energy and the U.S. from any construction activity until the U.S. State Department completed a supplemental review. 
The administration was appealing that decision in March when Trump revoked an earlier cross-border permit and issued a new one, effectively circumventing Morris’s ruling. 
The cases are Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Trump, 18-cv-118, and Indigenous Environmental Network v. Trump, 19-cv-00028, U.S. District Court, District of Montana (Great Falls).

"U.S. Sanctions Will Delay, Raise Costs Of Nord Stream 2 Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– U.S. sanctions on companies building a pipeline to boost Russian gas supplies to Europe will delay the completion of the project by several months and increase its cost, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives said on Monday. 
The group behind Nord Stream 2 has said it aims to complete the project seeking to double gas capacity along the northern Nord Stream pipeline route to Germany as soon as possible after U.S. sanctions prompted a contractor to suspend pipe-laying. 
The United States, which is seeking to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas to European states, says Nord Stream 2 will make Europe too reliant on Russian supplies. 
""The sanctions will temporarily delay completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” conservative lawmaker Peter Beyer told German public radio. ""But I believe that in the second half of next year the pipeline will be completed.” 
The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will run along the Baltic Sea floor, was expected to start up in the first half of 2020. 
""There are alternatives, which will bring with them delays as well as higher costs,” said Beyer. 
Merkel has condemned the decision but said her government would not retaliate against Trump’s sanctions. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday that the pipeline would be launched despite U.S. sanctions and that Russia would respond. 
Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled gas giant and a major backer of Nord Stream 2, already supplies more than a third of Europe's gas needs. 
Nord Stream 2 will help Russia bypass Ukraine, the main route for Russian gas. The two neighbouring countries, which are locked in military conflict that followed Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, agreed a new transit deal this week.  
Nord Stream 2 contractor, Swiss-Dutch company Allseas, announced on Friday it had suspended pipe-laying activities. 
Other partners in Nord Stream 2 are Austria’s OMV, the German firms Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo-Dutch energy major Royal Dutch Shell plc and France’s Engie.

Canadian Mainline Long-Term Toll Settlement Filed With CER | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TransCanada PipeLines Limited has filed an application with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) for approval of a six-year negotiated and unanimously supported settlement on Canadian Mainline tolls.
TCPL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TC Energy Corporation, has requested timely approval of the unanimous settlement to ensure certainty before terms come into effect in January 2021.
The Canadian Mainline is comprised of approximately 14,100 kilometres (8,761 miles) of pipeline and associated facilities and primarily transports Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin natural gas for delivery across the Prairie provinces and to markets in Eastern Canada and the United States.
The settlement, which highlights the continued importance of the Canadian Mainline, is the product of a comprehensive collaborative process of engagement and negotiation with Canadian Mainline customers, Russ Girling, TC Energy president and chief executive office, said in a statement. “It enhances competitiveness and provides toll certainty for our customers while maintaining stable revenue for TC Energy,” he added.
“We appreciate the efforts of industry to work with us to create innovative solutions that utilize this critical transportation link to enhance the long-term success of the WCSB.”
The settlement, which would be in effect from Jan. 1, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2026, is designed to facilitate cost-effective transportation of natural gas from the WCSB to eastern markets.
The agreement:

Sets an equity return of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed common equity, subject to variance depending on actual operating costs and natural gas throughput;
Sets tolls for the term for separate segments of the Canadian Mainline (Western Mainline and Eastern Triangle) providing a 20 per cent reduction from existing tolls on the western portion of the system that includes the path from Empress to Emerson;
Includes a sharing mechanism incenting TC Energy to achieve cost efficiencies and increased revenues; and
Affirms TC Energy’s pricing flexibility and allows new market-driven services to enhance flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.

CER Sets Date For Conclusion Of NGTL North Corridor Proceeding | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) is to present final reply argument and any reply to comments on conditions for its proposed $632 million North Corridor expansion before the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) on April 23, 2020.
Indigenous interveners are to present evidence at Indigenous knowledge sessions Feb. 4-6, 2020 in Peace River.
The CER has set a deadline of Nov. 26, 2020 (maximum 15 months) for it to prepare and issue a report to the federal cabinet. NGTL has asked it to recommend approval in a timely manner that would allow for the federal cabinet to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) no later than January 2021. Work is scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2021.
The North Corridor project is a proposed expansion of the NGTL System to transport gas from the Peace River Project Area (PRPA), northwest of James River and west of NGTL’s Meikle River compressor station, to growing intra-basin markets in the North of Bens Area (NOBA), east of Meikle River and north of the Bens Lake compressor station.
The project consists of a total of 81 kilometres of pipeline in three sections (56 kilometres of 48-inch pipe in two sections and 25 kilometres of 36-inch pipe in one section) and one compressor unit addition. It is underpinned by incremental firm transport-delivery (FT-D) contracts that exceed the capacity of the NGTL System beginning in 2022.

Government Extends 35% Assessment Reduction For Shallow Gas Assets For Second Year | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Gas producers will receive a 35 per cent property assessment reduction on shallow gas wells and pipelines for the 2020 tax year while the assessment system is overhauled.
This mirrors the provincial assistance provided in 2019 while the provincial government reviews property tax assessment for the oil and gas sector.
About 70,000 wells and associated pipelines in Alberta meet the criteria for the assessment reduction.
Kaycee Madu, minister of municipal affairs, said the government recognizes that many of Alberta’s shallow gas producers are continuing to struggle because of market conditions and high operating expenses, including property taxes based on outdated models.
He said until the new assessment models can be implemented, the government will provide the 35 per cent reduction on shallow gas assets for the 2020 tax year.
The government will continue to consult with municipalities and industry while it changes the model used to determine the value of assessments, particularly for oil and gas properties. Changes are expected to come into effect in 2021.
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) president Tim McMillan said Alberta has historically assessed its industry at a higher level relative to other jurisdictions, which means higher taxes and fewer jobs.
 “The province’s relief for shallow gas assets and its leadership in ensuring the 2020 assessment review does not adversely impact industry competitiveness sends a critical signal to the investment community that Alberta is open for business,” he said.
Dale Nally, associate minister of natural gas, said the government has implemented a number of actions that provided much-needed, short-term relief for Alberta’s natural gas producers, and is now shifting focus to the long term.
 “Providing the same property assessment reduction in 2020 as in 2019 will allow us to work with industry to fix Alberta’s assessment model, without having to rush the process,” he said.
The assessment models for linear property have not been updated since 2005.

Enbridge Says Canadian Mainline Contracts Could Boost WCSB Prices | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A proposal to introduce firm service on Enbridge Inc.’s Canadian Mainline in response to shipper requests is an important step to locking in long-term demand for Canadian crude to support future price outlooks, says a senior company executive.
Additionally, contracting should have a neutral to positive effect on western Canadian oil prices, in Enbridge’s view and in the evidence filed with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) in an application for a  new service and tolling framework, Guy Jarvis, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines, said Thursday in a conference call.
“The producing community, whether they plan to ship on our system or not, is worried about price and we get that,” he said. “We are going to continue spending a lot more time with as many producers as possible to make sure that we can get them comfortable with our view of how this is going to impact them.”
Earlier this fall, in response to concerns raised by some shippers about access to the Mainline, the CER halted an Enbridge open season until the regulator had approved all tolls and associated terms and conditions. The proceeding is expected to take 12-14 months, including a hearing in the second half of 2020.
The application for contracted and uncommitted service includes the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service which Enbridge hopes to offer in an open season in the first quarter of 2021 following CER approval of the package. The target implementation date is the later of July 1, 2021 or the completion of the Line 3 replacement which restores the line’s capacity to 760,000 bbls/d, about 370,000 bbls/d more than today.
Jarvis said the regulatory filing is the result of more than 18 months of negotiation with its shippers to arrive at a negotiated package that recognizes the needs of customers in a balanced way.
 In response to question, he said that given the strong support for the negotiated open season package there were only a couple of small changes, including a change to the credit requirements sought by smaller producers. For example, Enbridge had been seeking credit support for 90 days, up from the current requirement for 60 days, but it has agreed to continue with the 60 days “given how tough the environment is for a lot of these small players,” said Jarvis.
“We believe our contracting offer is very attractive to anyone wanting to ship on our system,” he said. “It provides capacity certainty and priority access; the tolls are competitive with an up to 10 per cent reduction from expected tolls were the current CTS (competitive  toll settlement) … to continue; multiple contracting options are available to meet the needs of our diverse shipping group and the Mainline continues to offer unmatched market access and flexibility.”
The proposal also continues to competitively position the Mainline with incentives to maximize throughput which is so important to its customers, according to the application.
Open season 
The open season will allow non-discriminatory open access to securing capacity for all interested shippers, including smaller companies that can contract for as little as 2,200 bbls/d, said Jarvis. If a company’s production declines or is shut in, the producer will not have to pay to ship volumes it doesn’t produce. “We believe the approach that we have proposed for the open season is the gold standard in terms of allowing all potential participants to participate,” he said.
The proposed new contract carriage service will enable shippers to contract for priority access on a long-term basis for up to 90 per cent of Canadian Mainline capacity of 3.25 million bbls/d (including a fully replaced Line 3) compared to the current common carrier service in which shippers can obtain capacity only on a month-to-month basis.
“Given the physical attributes and operational complexities of the Enbridge Mainline system, the specific capacity that Enbridge will offer for contracts is different for each Service Haul Segment and petroleum type,” says the application.  Contractible capacity within each of the short, medium and long haul segments will be allocated equally to contracts for service from Edmonton and from Hardisty, subject to a limit for service from Edmonton, in part because there is less pipeline capacity available from Edmonton.
The application provides for two basic types of Transportation Services Agreements (TSAs): take-or-pay or a requirements contract created to make contracting accessible for shippers for whom contracting might not otherwise be feasible. All TSAs provide contracting shippers with priority access to the Canadian Mainline in return for their commitment to ship a specified volume of petroleum each month.
A number of discounts may be provided to contract shippers, depending on total volume that Enbridge contracts and the total volume shipped in a month. Additional toll discounts are available to those subscribing for larger volumes or longer terms.
The application includes 13 letters of support from producers, integrated producers and refiners, most of them existing shippers representing more than 70 per cent of current crude oil throughput on the Mainline. “These shippers have expressed interest in contracting, in aggregate, for an even greater percentage of the contractible crude oil capacity [medium and long haul segments] Enbridge will offer in the open season,” says the company.
Uncommitted shipments 
Enbridge will reserve a minimum of 10 per cent (325,000 bbls/d) of the available Mainline capacity for shipments of spot or uncommitted volumes which will continue to be available for nominations on a month-to-month basis. That volume is more than on competing pipeline systems such as Keystone which has a minimum of six per cent uncontracted capacity.
In addition, as any contracted capacity that is not used for contract shipments may be available for spot shipments, more than 10 per cent of capacity may be available in a given month, said Jarvis.
The available capacity of the Enbridge Mainline also is expandable and the company has several options that may allow for its optimization by approximately 200,000 bbls/d through enhancements such as drag reducing agents and additional horsepower at pump stations, Enbridge says in its application.
However, “Enbridge requires certainty that the existing Enbridge Mainline will continue to be used over the long-term,” it says. “The best way for Enbridge to ensure long-term utilization of existing capacity is to enter into long-term contracts.”
Pipe-to-pipe competition 
Enbridge says the introduction of firm service will support the long-term competitive operation of the Mainline. “It will position Enbridge to compete with other oil pipelines that provide shippers from the WCSB with priority access to capacity and toll certainty,” it says. “It will also assist Enbridge in securing volumes for the Mainline over the longer-term.”
According to the company, the Canadian Mainline faces competition from existing and future pipelines exiting Western Canada. These include Keystone, Keystone XL, the Trans Mountain expansion and Trans Mountain. All have contracts in place that contract the majority of their capacity to firm service on a long-term basis except for Trans Mountain which has firm service on some of its existing capacity.
“Firm service levels the playing field with other firm-service pipelines and promotes efficient competition,” says Enbridge.  “Firm service will enhance the ability of the Canadian Mainline to attract and retain shippers when those shippers consider firm service alternatives on other pipelines. This promotes pipe-to-pipe competition.”
In addition, firm service will advance the Canadian government’s goals of enhancing Canada’s global competitiveness, providing certainty to investors and stakeholders and driving innovation, as set out in the preamble to the CER Act, says the company.
Tolls 
The committed base toll is US$5.70/bbl for a heavy crude oil movement from Hardisty to Chicago (Lockport, Mokena, Griffith and Flanagan). From that toll, Enbridge and potential shippers negotiated discounts, an adjustment mechanism and surcharges,
Due to the integrated nature of the Enbridge Mainline, the committed tolls for Canadian local and international transportation movements are calculated on a system-wide distance basis (Canada and the United States). Committed tolls are in U.S. dollars for both the Canadian local and for international movements.
The uncommitted transportation tolls are at a premium to the committed tolls to recognize the different circumstances between committed shippers that have made long-term financial commitments to the Canadian Mainline and spot shippers that have not, says Enbridge.
The premium of US29 cents/bbl (about five per cent) was the subject of negotiation with shippers and results in a base uncommitted toll of US$5.99/bbl. The premium for all other receipt and delivery point pairings is determined by adjusting the 29 cent/bbl premium to reflect distance and commodity type. The adjusted premium is then added to the committed base tolls to determine the uncommitted transportation toll for receipt and delivery point pairings.
The uncommitted transportation tolls include the transmission toll, receipt and delivery terminalling tolls and the Line 3 replacement surcharge. Similar to committed tolls, they are calculated on a system-wide distance basis.

Court Reserves Decision On Challenge To Trans Mountain Expansion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — A panel of judges reserved its decision on Wednesday after hearing arguments from First Nations groups that the Canadian government had failed to properly consult them on expanding its oil pipeline.
The challenge to the Federal Court of Appeal is the latest obstacle to tripling capacity on the Alberta-to-British Columbia Trans Mountain pipeline.
“It feels like an acrimonious divorce. Obviously there’s a lot of tension here,” Chief Justice Marc Noël said, before saying the judges needed time to make a decision after a three-day hearing.
The operator of the pipeline had asked the court to dismiss the legal challenge by four Indigenous groups.
The Indigenous groups “did not negotiate in good faith, or at all,” Trans Mountain Corporation lawyer Maureen Killoran said. Effectively, the groups are attempting to hold a veto more than $10 billion project despite the government’s best attempts to address their concerns, she said.
“This was not a drive-by consultation,” Killoran said.
Coldwater Indian Band, one of the four groups, refused to allow drilling for a hydro-geological study to determine risks to its aquifer, she said. The band said earlier this week that protecting its drinking water was its main concern.
The Indigenous groups alleged that the Canadian government shared key reports on the project's impact late, or even after the consultation period, and that it revised documents. Their concerns include possible oil spills and threats to endangered southern resident killer whales.
Ottawa bought the pipeline last year to ensure expansion proceeded, offering a lifeline to Alberta’s struggling oilpatch. Congested pipelines have forced the Alberta provincial government to curtail production.
A court ruled in August 2018 that Ottawa had failed to properly consult Indigenous people, prompting the government to redo the consultation process before reapproving the expansion in June. But in September, the Court of Appeal agreed to hear fresh concerns that the government fell short again.
In a written submission, Alberta’s government said consultation for Trans Mountain was more extensive than that of any other Canadian infrastructure project, and federal approval should remain in place.
“Regulatory instability and legal uncertainty negatively affect reliable planning ... and put a chill on investor confidence,” lawyers for Alberta's attorney general wrote.
""Consultation is unworkable when, as in this case, it appears the only compromise acceptable to an Indigenous group is abandonment of the project,” they added.

"U.S. Concedes Defeat On Nord Stream 2 Project, Officials Say | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) — The U.S. has little leverage to prevent the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany from being completed, two administration officials said, acknowledging the failure of a years-long effort to head off what officials believe is a threat to European security.
The massive $11-billion project is just weeks away from completion and has led President Donald Trump to call Germany “a captive to Russia.” He has criticized the European Union for not doing more to diversify imports away from the nation that supplies more than a third of its gas.
Senior U.S. administration officials, who asked not to be identified discussing the administration’s take on the project, said sanctions that passed Congress on Tuesday as part of a defense bill are too late to have any effect. The U.S. instead will try to impose costs on other Russian energy projects, one of the officials added.
The admission is a rare concession on what had been a top foreign-policy priority for the Trump administration and highlights how European allies such as Germany have been impervious to American pressure to abandon the pipeline. It also shows how the U.S. has struggled to deter Russia from flexing its muscles on issues ranging from energy to Ukraine to election interference.
“It has been a commercial project, but with a huge geopolitical dimension attached to that,” Peter Beyer, who is German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s trans-Atlantic policy coordinator, told Bloomberg Television in an interview in Berlin on Wednesday. “I’m expecting that the sanctions, if Donald Trump is going to sign that bill, will not have a big effect on that project.”
The administration is hoping to sharpen its focus on Russia when Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who was confirmed as ambassador to the country last week, heads to Moscow next month. The post has been vacant since early October, when former envoy Jon Huntsman stepped down, and ties between the two countries have only continued to sour.
On a visit to Poland in February, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the Nord Stream 2 project “funnels money to Russians in ways that undermine European national security.”
Who’s dependent on Russia’s gas?
Trump has indicated that he’ll sign the legislation passed Tuesday. The penalties on companies building the project, led by Russian energy company Gazprom PJSC, would be effective immediately, according to a Senate Republican aide.
Some 350 companies are involved in building the undersea link, most notably the Swiss company Allseas Group SA, whose ships are laying the last section of pipe in Danish waters.
The sanctions targets vessels that lay the pipeline as well as executives from companies linked to those ships. They could be denied visas and have transactions related to their U.S.-based property or interests blocked.
The sanctions bill includes a 30-day “wind-down period” that allows targeted companies to halt their operations after the law comes into effect. Yet that could give Gazprom just enough time to finish work.
The last section of pipe can be completed by about Jan. 11, well before the end of the period, according to Anna Borisova, an analyst at BloombergNEF in London. Nord Stream 2 will be in a position to be commissioned between April and June 2020, after additional connection work and testing, she said.
“The project seems safe,” Borisova said. “We don’t see major risks.”
Trying to stymie that strategy, U.S. Senators Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson sent a letter to AllSeas CEO Edward Heerema Wednesday warning the company that it would face “crushing and potentially fatal” sanctions if it continued work on the pipeline. The senators said that the 30-day “wind-down” period was not intended to give AllSeas time to finish the project.
“If you were to attempt to finish the pipeline in the next 30 days, you would devastate your shareholders’ value and destroy the future financial viability of your company,” they wrote.
The new pipeline is set to ship as much as 55 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually directly to Germany, doubling capacities of the existing Nord Stream link. The U.S. and Eastern European nations see it as a threat to the Ukrainian transit route that has been in place for decades, bringing revenues to the smaller Former Soviet Union nation. The new link theoretically gives Russia the ability to bypass Ukraine as a transit corridor.
Gas traders in Europe are watching carefully for the date when work will finish and gas flows will start through Nord Stream 2. Its importance has increased along with tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which are negotiating a renewal for the 10-year gas transit contract that expires this month. Officials from the two countries plan and the European Commission plan to discuss the matter in Berlin on Thursday.
The completion of Nord Stream 2 could would bring fresh supplies of gas to Europe’s already glutted market. That would make it more difficult for the U.S. to gain a bigger foothold in shipping cargoes of liquefied natural gas by tanker into Europe.
U.S. sales of the fuel made up 26 per cent of imports in November. Flexible terms for contracts from U.S. producers mean that they will sell to where prices are highest, meaning more cargoes may head to Asia in the coming months.
Beyer recognized the need for Europe to buy the fuel from a wider range of sellers.
“From a European standpoint, not only German, we need to diversify our energy interests,” he said. “We are also interested in receiving LNG from the United States of America.”

Trudeau Government Planned ‘No Conspiracy’ To Get Pipeline Built: Attorney | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — The Canadian government tried its best to consult Indigenous groups about plans to expand its oil pipeline and undertook “no conspiracy” to ram it through the approval stage, a federal lawyer said in court on Tuesday.
A court ruled in August 2018 that Ottawa had failed to properly consult Indigenous People, prompting the government to redo the process before reapproving the Trans Mountain expansion project in June. But in September, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed to hear fresh concerns from four Indigenous groups that the government fell short again in consulting them.
A three-day hearing began in Vancouver on Monday to hear those concerns. The project is one of several stalled pipeline expansions proposed to ease the oil industry’s congested export channels.
The Canadian government consulted 129 groups and was determined to be transparent, providing internal notes about the project’s potential impact despite not being legally required to do so, said its lawyer, Dayna Anderson.
“There’s no conspiracy, there’s no suppression, there's no alteration of scientific views, there’s no nefarious action going on,” Anderson said. “There was good-faith engagement.”
The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity to move 890,000 bbls/d from Alberta to a port terminal near Vancouver. Construction continues despite the court challenge.
One Indigenous community told a different story earlier on Tuesday.
Squamish Nation in British Columbia received government reports on the impact of marine spills only after federal consultations with its officials had concluded in June, Michelle Bradley, a lawyer for Squamish said.
When it did receive the reports – peer reviews of Indigenous groups’ expert reports – Squamish said it discovered too late for discussion that the government's own scientists agreed with the communities that much is not understood about how spilled bitumen would react in bodies of water.
“Information was disclosed far too late,” Bradley said. “It took place in a flurry of activity at the very end or even after the consultative process.”
Anderson, the government's attorney, said the information in question were summaries, not peer reviews.
Understanding the impacts of a bigger pipeline are important, especially because of threats from noise and marine traffic to endangered southern resident killer whales, Squamish lawyer Matthew Kirchner said.
“We don’t know how much more the whales can take.”
The hearing is scheduled to last through Wednesday, when lawyers for Alberta and Saskatchewan are among the scheduled speakers.

"One Million Bbl Expansion At Hardisty Terminal Sanctioned, Says Gibson | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Gibson Energy Inc. has sanctioned the construction of one million bbls of new tankage at its Hardisty terminal.
 “The sanction of two new tanks at the Top of the Hill will further increase our high-quality, long-term infrastructure revenues and drive continued distributable cash flow per share growth,” said Steve Spaulding, president and chief executive officer.  “We are also very pleased to welcome a new refining customer to the terminal, reflecting the importance of Hardisty to downstream players looking to secure heavy crude feedstocks from Western Canada.
“In addition, we remain in discussions for further tankage opportunities, leading to our confidence in our ability to continue to sanction tankage at a rate of two to four tanks per year in 2020, and beyond.”
Expansion at Hardisty 
Gibson has sanctioned the construction of two new 500,000-barrel tanks at the Top of the Hill portion of the Hardisty terminal.  The additional tankage represents an expansion of the fourth phase of development at the Top of the Hill, which will be placed into service by the end of 2020.
The new tankage will be constructed at a capital cost consistent with the company’s target build multiple of five to seven times EBITDA under long-term, take-or-pay and stable fee-based contracts.  One of the tanks is contracted to a new investment grade refining customer, while the second tank will be leased to Gibson’s Marketing segment under an intercompany agreement with the Infrastructure segment.
In November 2019, Gibson placed four new tanks or two million bbls of tankage into service, ahead of schedule and within target capital costs. 
With the sanction of additional tankage at the Top of the Hill portion of its Hardisty terminal, Gibson currently has three tanks representing 1.5 million bbls of tankage currently under construction.  Once the fourth phase of development at the Top of the Hill is placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2020, Gibson will have approximately 13.5 million bbls of storage capacity at its Hardisty terminal.

"Illegally Traded Chemical Halted Russian Oil Pipeline, Tests Show | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — The substance that brought one of Russia’s longest oil pipelines to a halt in April was carbon tetrachloride, a lethal chemical meant to be tightly controlled by an international agreement, according to the results of three separate, undisclosed tests seen by Reuters.
A summary of the results of a test carried out for Russia’s Ministry of Energy and for Transneft, the operator of the pipeline, by a Moscow-based state chemical laboratory seen by Reuters in May, which has not previously been reported, shows that the contaminant was 85 per cent carbon tetrachloride.
The presence of carbon tetrachloride suggests Russia has not stamped out illegal trade in the chemical, five oil industry sources said. Carbon tetrachloride is supposed to be strictly regulated by Russian law, these sources said.
Russia’s energy ministry has blamed the stoppage in the Druzhba pipeline on a legally traded solvent called ethylene dichloride, an organic chloride compound used to clean oil wells, which can corrode equipment if it enters a refinery, according to industry experts.
Russia’s Ministry of Energy and Transneft did not reply to Reuters requests for comment
Two separate tests performed by two different companies, a European Union refiner and an international oil trading firm – which both told Reuters they unwittingly bought tainted crude from the pipeline – yielded almost identical results to the tests conducted by the Moscow state laboratory, two sources familiar with the findings told Reuters.
The sources asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
Transneft said in June that 200 to 300 tonnes of an unnamed contaminant had entered the pipeline, but has not since made public any further details on the matter.
Russia, the world’s second-biggest oil exporter, lost more than $1 billion in revenue due to the more than month-long stoppage of the pipeline, which carries about one per cent of the global supply of crude oil from Russia to refineries in eastern and central Europe. The pipeline fully restarted normal operations on July 1.
Russian authorities are still investigating the contamination, which affected about five million tonnes of oil in the pipeline stretching from Russia to Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic via Belarus and Ukraine.
Four people are in custody, suspected by Russian investigators of introducing contaminated oil into the pipeline at an intake station in the Samara region of Russia, while two other suspects have fled the country, law enforcement sources have told Russian news agencies. Two of those held in custody have admitted some wrongdoing, according to their lawyers.
Reuters could not determine exactly how or why the substance entered the pipeline.
Ozone-depleting chemical
Carbon tetrachloride was widely used in the past to make refrigerants, fire-extinguishing materials and cleaning agents.
Its production has dropped sharply since the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to limit the use of ozone-depleting substances, took effect in 1989.
Under the protocol, which has been ratified by every nation, governments are charged with controlling production of certain chemicals and their compliance is monitored by the United Nations Environment Programme’s Ozone Secretariat.
Nevertheless, four oil traders in Russia’s Tatarstan and Samara regions, where authorities say the tainted oil entered the Druzhba pipeline, told Reuters they regularly obtain carbon tetrachloride to bulk up more expensive bona fide oil products.
The traders, who asked not to be named, said producers of the chemical often give it away or even pay third parties to take it away, making it lucrative to mix with oil and sell the resulting mixture on at a profit.
A spokeswoman for the U.N. Ozone Secretariat said its senior members were not immediately available for comment.
Russia allows only two plants to produce carbon tetrachloride, under quotas approved by the prime minister, to be used as an ingredient for creating other chemicals: the Khimprom plant, owned by Orgsintez Group, in the Chuvashia region, and a plant owned by Galopolimer in Kirovo-Chepetsk.
In each case, any waste containing carbon tetrachloride must be burned and cannot be bought or sold without a guarantee that it will be processed or destroyed, according to Russian law and the terms of the Montreal Protocol.
However, rather than being destroyed, waste containing carbon tetrachloride is being regularly moved across Russia in trains and tanker trucks to unspecified customers, according to five local traders.
Galopolimer did not reply to requests for comment.
Two local traders in southwest Russia said they had bought organic chloride waste from Khimprom to resell and that the chemical company had sent it by truck to the Tatarstan region.
A spokeswoman for Orgsintez Group said Khimprom does supply carbon tetrachloride to companies that use it to produce titanium, zirconium or as part of other chemical processes, but declined to name any customers, saying that was internal information.
She said Khimprom does not destroy carbon tetrachloride, but receives guarantees from customers to which it sells the chemical that it will be fully processed or destroyed as the law requires.
Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear corporation, which was due to become responsible for chemical waste disposal from July this year under a government act, did not reply to a request for comment.

Study Says IAA Project List Unlikely To Restrict New Energy Pipelines | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
It’s unlikely the project list for the federal government’s new Impact Assessment Act will be a “disabler” of new major infrastructure projects, especially oil and gas pipelines, a new study has concluded.
“Specific to oil and gas projects, it’s actually more lenient on projects compared to the [previous] Canadian Energy Assessment Act  (CEAA 2012)  list,”  Victoria Goodday, author of the study by the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, said in an interview.
 The study, Demystifying Bill C-69: The Project List,  compared regulations for projects that will automatically require federal review to those under CEAA. Like the previous legislation, the IAA relies on regulations (the project list) to identify the types of projects with the most potential for adverse environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction.
Under the new regulations, pipelines requiring 75 kilometres or more of a new right-of-way will be designated for a federal impact assessment compared to 40 kilometres or more of new pipeline required under CEAA 2012. “This means that pipelines built within an already established right-of-way will no longer be automatically designated,” she said.
The list though, is just one part of what will determine whether a federal review will be required. For example, a review likely would be ordered if the pipeline were to have an impact on Indigenous communities, said Goodday.
The government also has amended the project list to include pipeline decommissioning and abandonment for onshore pipelines and has removed a separate entry for end-of-life activities which means that only one federal assessment now is required over the lifetime of a pipeline project.
The project list is based on sectors and there are a variety of changes and “it’s a mixed bag of impacts,” she said. “Overall, I think it’s an improved format for how to determine which projects trigger a federal review.”
A designated project requires at least initial review by federal authorities, with a later determination of whether a full federal impact assessment is necessary. As in CEAA, the IAA enables the responsible minister to designate any project for federal review (based on prescribed factors), even if it’s not on the project list.
On the oil and gas production side, in situ oilsands extraction facilities are subject to federal review for the first time although an exemption is available. The IAA will apply to a facility with a production capacity of 2,000 cubic metres/d (about 12,500 bbls/d) or more unless the facility is in a province with a legislated (and unreached) greenhouse gas emissions limit for oilsands sites — currently the case in Alberta.
The 100 megatonne limit on oilsands emissions introduced by the previous NDP government is still in place, Goodday noted. “That puts the ball in Alberta’s court, so to speak, because it gives the government some control over whether or not those in situ projects will be subject to federal review.”
Among petroleum-based energy projects (oil, gas and coal), 50 per cent (14)  of the project descriptions were unchanged from CEAA while the descriptions became more stringent through broadened scope for six types of projects and less stringent for another five types of projects, including a slight increase in the storage capacity allowed before an LNG facility triggers federal review.
Projects in which the scope was broadened include “liquefied petroleum gas storage facility” which was replaced with the more general “natural gas liquids storage facility” and “fossil fuel-fired electrical generating facility” with “fossil fuel-fired power generating facility.”
Oilsands mining entries remained unchanged although all other types of mines are now allowed a production capacity two-thirds to three times greater than that prescribed under CEAA.
“Because both the IAA and CEAA take a designated project-based approach, their reach is still significantly less than that of the environmental assessment regime in place for the 20 years prior [to 2012],” says the study. “Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 1992, a federal assessment was triggered for any project in which a federal authority was involved, with a wide berth for how “involvement” was defined.”
Relative to CEAA, 36 project descriptions were unchanged or not significantly changed in the IAA, 28 were adjusted to be less stringent, and 26 became more stringent.
A total of 114 unique project types are now designated under the IAA compared to 98 under CEAA with 20 project types added and eight removed. Most (13) of the new project entries are for projects located specifically in a national park or federally protected area, in line with the government’s commitment to protect and conserve Canada’s wilderness, says the study.
Proponents of offshore wind or tidal energy projects are more likely to face increased scrutiny while thresholds were raised for 11 of the 13 mining projects listed, including both coal mine entries.
The School of Public Policy plans further studies on Bill C-69 such as the scope of the actual impact assessment process and the basis on which a final decision is made, said Goodday.
 “My understanding is that these pieces get conflated and each one might impact an industry differently,” she said. “Where we see oil and gas projects are facing less stringent guidelines when it comes to automatic designations, in another component of the legislation they might face more difficulties.”

"Demand Forecast To Grow To 14.1 Bcf/d By 2023/24, Says NGTL | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) in its 2019 annual plan filed with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has identified 10 facilities on which it is proposing to spend a total of $1.445 billion with target in-service dates in November 2022 and April 2023.
The plan provides for spending of $763 million on four aggregate system facilities required to transport growing system supply in the Peace River Project Area to satisfy increased intra-system demands. Another $493 million is proposed for five projects to meet the aggregate delivery requirements at the Alberta-British Columbia export point. In addition, $189 million is proposed for one facility in the Medicine Hat area to transport in more receipts from outside the area to offset declining local supply.
No additional extension facilities, lateral loops or receipt and delivery meter stations are included the plan.
The annual plan forecasts continued growth in aggregate system demand of 12 per cent to 14.1 bcf/d in 2023/2024 from 12.6 bcf/d in 2019/2020.
Average annual daily deliveries (daily flow) to intra-Alberta markets on the NGTL System are expected to increase to 6.9 bcf/d in 2023/24 from 6.1 bcf/d in 2019/2020, primarily due to industrial demand in the oilsands sector and gas-fired electrical generation. Forecast throughput at major export points also increases to 7.2 bcf/d in 2023/24 from 6.6 bcf/d in 2019/2020.
On the receipt side, NGTL expects conventional production to continue to decline, mostly in the north and east parts of the basin which are outside the Peace River Project Area. Increasing volumes of Montney and Deep Basin gas are entering the system, more than offsetting production declines in other areas, as exploration activity has focused on unconventional shale and tight sandstone reservoirs.
The decline rate of legacy gas and the more recent supply from the shale and tight sandstone reservoirs varies across the basin and from year to year, says NGTL. Typically, the basin declines about 20 per cent (18 per cent to 22 per cent) per year if left unsupported without new wells, it says.
Average system receipts in the Peace River are projected to grow to 12.8 bcf/d (90 per cent of the total system supply) by 2023/24 from 10.7 bcf/d (84 per cent of the total) in 2019/20, while North and East receipts decline to 300 mmcf/d from 400 mmcf/d in 2019/20. Mainline receipts also are forecast to decline to 1.1 bcf/d in 2023/24 from 1.6 bcf/d.
In its plan, NGTL says its parent, TC Energy Corporaton, considers commodity pricing to determine the economic viability of future production. It forecasts that Nova Inventory Transfer (NIT)/AECO average natural gas prices will rise to around C$1.67/gigajoule to $2.67/gigajoule by 2024.
Forecast annual average daily flow rates are translated into peak day design flows which are used for system facility design, growing to 18.9 bcf/d in 2023/34 from 14.9 bcf/d in 2019/2020. The increasing design flows are supported by increasing FT-R (firm transportation-receipt) and FT-D (firm transportation-delivery)
The annual plan describes NGTL’s long-term outlook for receipts, deliveries, peak expected flows, proposed facilities and design flow requirements supporting the proposed facilities. The 2019 plan is based on NGTL’s June 2019 design forecast of receipts and deliveries.
The facilities identified in the plan were presented to NGTL’s tolls, tariffs, facilities and procedures (TTFP) committee last month.

Court Told Ottawa Listened Half-Heartedly To Indigenous People’s Pipeline Concerns | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — The Canadian government was accused on Monday of merely going through the motions of consulting Indigenous people about its expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline at a court hearing to determine the future of the politically charged project.
The three-day hearing is taking place in the Federal Court of Appeal in Vancouver, which agreed in September to consider concerns from four Indigenous groups that the government’s consultation this year was insufficient.
The legal challenge is the latest setback for Trans Mountain, which is one of several stalled pipeline expansions proposed to ease congested export channels.
The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity to move 890,000 bbls/d from Alberta to a port terminal near Vancouver. Construction continues despite the court challenge.
The Canadian government was determined to approve Trans Mountain’s expansion, based on public comments by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ministers, and the fact that it purchased the project, Scott Smith, lawyer for Tsleil-Waututh Nation, told the court.
The government initially withheld reports on the project’s impact and did not meaningfully discuss potential marine spills with Indigenous groups, Smith said. A report written by the federal environment department appeared to have been revised to make it more positive, he added.
“[Government] was unilaterally focused on, to use the minister of finance’s words, getting shovels into the ground,” Smith said.
The Canadian government is scheduled to present its case on Tuesday. A Natural Resources department spokeswoman said the government approved the project after meaningful dialogue that resulted in new measures to accommodate Indigenous concerns.
The court took the rare step of webcasting the hearing. Several dozen observers, including indigenous people, filled a small courtroom and overflow room.
“Again First Nations have to go back to court in Canada to make them listen to us,” said Chief Lee Spahan of the Coldwater Indian Band prior to the hearing, using a term for Canadian indigenous communities.
Coldwater has not rejected the project outright, but wants drinking water safeguards, lawyer Matthew Kirchner said.
The government set too short a timetable to meaningfully consult the Ts’elxweyeqw Tribe, whose land Trans Mountain crosses, its lawyer Joelle Walker said.
In Ottawa, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government hopes to eventually sell Trans Mountain and is open to Indigenous ownership.
""Our objective overall is to make sure the indigenous people along the route can be engaged, [and] that there could be benefits ... for Indigenous people more broadly,"" he said.
Ottawa bought the pipeline in 2018 from Kinder Morgan Canada Limited’s Canadian unit when it appeared the company might abandon the expansion.

Tourmaline Expects Capex Of $925 Million For 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Tourmaline Oil Corp. is forecasting a 2020 EP capital spending program of $925 million. 
Its average production guidance is 315,000 – 320,000 boe/d. The company anticipates 2020 free cash flow of $345 million utilizing strip commodity pricing.  The 2020 free cash flow will be employed for share buybacks, possible dividend increases, and continuing debt reduction.  Tourmaline is targeting a 2020 exit net debt-to-cash flow ratio of 1.2 times.  The company has also updated the five-year development plan.  Annual free cash flow grows steadily through the plan, yielding aggregate free cash flow of $1.75 billion, based on strip pricing.
Acquisition activity in 2020 will be funded via the additional funds raised through the creation of Topaz Energy Corp.  Including the Tourmaline-owned equity position in Topaz, the company has access to over $800 million for select acquisition activity.  Production and cash flow realized through acquisition activities will be incremental to the five-year plan.
The 2019 production exit target of 315,000 – 320,000 boe/d was achieved during the second week of December, with total corporate production reaching a record 317,000 boe/d.  The total liquid (oil, condensate, NGLs) production exit target of 68,000 bbls/d was also achieved in the same early December time frame, which includes 31,000 bbls/d of light oil and condensate.
Subsequently, an unplanned production interruption at the Pembina Pipeline Corporation Saturn deep cut facility in the Alberta Deep Basin, starting on Dec. 10, has reduced current NGL production by approximately 11,200 bbls/d. This interruption, originally expected to last two days, has now been extended until early January 2020 to replace a turbine in the sales gas compressor. The outage, combined with a seven-day turnaround at Saturn in October 2019 intended for preventative maintenance, will reduce total quarterly liquid production by approximately 3,500 bbls/d and overall quarterly average production volumes by approximately 2,500 boe/d.
Planned and unplanned shut-ins on the NEBC Enbridge Inc. system during Q4 for pipeline integrity inspections and associated cleaning tool runs have further reduced fourth quarter production by approximately 2,500 boe/d.  Tourmaline expects Q4 2019 average production of approximately 302,000 boe/d incorporating these unscheduled midstream outages, an increase of over 12,000 boe/d compared to the Q3 2019 average of 289,594 boe/d.
Tourmaline will enter 2020 already producing at the forecast 2020 production range of 315,000 – 320,000, which includes an increased downtime provision for these unscheduled third-party interruptions equivalent to what was experienced in 2019.

Trans Mountain Pipeline Faces Latest Legal Challenge In Canada Court | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — The Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion faces its latest legal hurdle in a federal court this week as Indigenous groups appeal the pipeline’s expansion, arguing the government did not adequately consult them before approving it.
A three-day hearing begins on Monday at the Federal Court of Appeal in Vancouver, which agreed to hear concerns from the Coldwater Indian band, the Squamish Nation, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and others that the government’s second consultation with them on the project this year was “window-dressing, box-ticking and nice-sounding words.”
The legal challenge is the latest setback for Trans Mountain, whose previous owners first proposed the expansion in 2013, as well as two pipeline projects proposed separately by TC Energy Corporation and Enbridge Inc that would provide badly needed transport for Alberta’s oil.
Congestion in Canadian pipelines has forced the Alberta government to order production curtailments this year.
The Trans Mountain expansion would alleviate congestion by nearly tripling the pipeline’s capacity to 890,000 bbls/d.
But the expansion has faced prolonged opposition from environmental activists and some Indigenous groups.
The appeals have not stopped construction, which has been underway since late summer and accelerated this month.
But legal challenges have created a great deal of uncertainty, Mark Pinney, manager of market economics at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said by telephone.
“One thing the industry needs right now to help it through the difficult times is more certainty,” Pinney said.
In the lead-up to October's federal election, in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals were running in part on their support of Canada’s indigenous population, the government offered no submissions to support its claim that the consultation had been meaningful.
This left the court to conclude that the appellants’ concerns met the standard for leave to appeal.
Should the appeal succeed, it would further erode investor confidence in the struggling Canadian oil industry and weaken Trudeau as he attempts to placate angry Albertans, who feel his party has not done enough to protect their main industry.
Stewart Phillip, grand chief of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, said the environmental concerns of Indigenous communities have not been adequately addressed and “remain the bedrock” of their fight.
Canadian Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters at the United Nations-hosted climate conference in Madrid on Wednesday that carbon emissions that would be produced by TMX have been accounted for in the Liberals’ plan to get Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050.

CER Clears Entire Westcoast System For Return To Full Operating Pressure | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc.’s entire Westcoast Energy Inc. system is back to full operating pressure after a pipeline rupture and fire last year on a 36-inch loop of the T-South system northeast of Prince George.
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) says it has cleared the last two segments of the 12-segment pipeline as safe to operate at full operating pressure following the Oct. 9, 2018 incident.
The majority of the T-South system which runs from south of Station 2 to Huntington had been operating at 85 per cent pressure as ordered by the National Energy Board (NEB). As part of its commitment to safety following the pipeline rupture, the company voluntarily reduced the pressure on its Fort St. John Mainline and the Grizzly pipeline which are part of the Westcoast T-North system.
The CER said a six-member team of pipeline integrity specialists and engineers spent more than a year analyzing and verifying data submitted by the company.  The assessment process involved multiple technical meetings with the company, field inspections to observe the company’s testing and analysis procedures, and other compliance verification activities to confirm the company’s integrity management program improvements implemented following the incident.
The Canadian Transport Safety Board, which investigated the pipeline rupture, has not yet released its report into the cause.

Enbridge Westcoast Expansions Expected To Continue | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc. has more than doubled its investment in Westcoast’s T-North and T-South over the last several years and expects expansions to continue for years to come, a senior company official said Tuesday.
 “Our T-North and T-South pipelines are playing a really significant role already by providing upstream transportation for LNG Canada and Woodfibre Squamish,” Bill Yardley, executive vice-president and president of natural gas and midstream, told the company’s investor day. “A world class gas supply and proximity to Asia makes Western Canada ideal for LNG export projects.”
Enbridge recently received Canada Energy Regulator (CER) approval for the $1 billion T-South reliability and expansion project. “This is a great investment on T-South to serve both growing demand of domestic needs in Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest but also an LNG export market, all under a cost-of-service framework,” he said. The project is expected to come into service in 2021, about the same time as its $500 million Spruce Ridge project in T-North which provides needed access for Montney producers trying to reach export markets, said Yardley.
Another area of focus is the Westcoast Gas Transmission Connector pipeline which has been on the books for some time, analysts heard. “It’s got a nicely-developed route to Prince Rupert, it’s scalable and cost-effective,” he said. “Any of the next phase LNG projects that have Prince Rupert in their sights are talking to us with regard to the West Coast Connector.”  
Enbridge also is exploring the development of natural gas liquids infrastructure in Canada “not G&Ps” (gathering and processing) so that its customers can fully monetize the liquids that currently are entrained in the gas stream and don’t have an outlet, said Yardley. It has filed a project description with the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) for Project Frontier which would involve building an NGL extraction facility, a pipeline and associated facilities in northeastern British Columbia, possibly as early as 2024.  
“We just want to help,” he said in response to a question about the project, noting that Enbridge has seen a similar situation in the U.S. “We said we are either going to have to develop or have a gas quality specification because downstream that ultimately becomes a problem; pilot lights start going out if you have your Btu content too high,” he said.
“We are a long way from that but we can see that and infrastructure doesn’t pop up overnight  … so we feel that we are part of the solution here. If we are not part of the solution, somebody ultimately will be or there is going to have to be some governance on what gas can enter the system and nobody wants that to happen.”
Yardley said he doesn’t think Enbridge is thinking about it as “let’s get into NGL infrastructure.” Rather, “we’re just saying there’s a clear need, it’s on our system, ultimately our customers’ problem is our problem, so why can’t we solve that?”
In looking at future growth, the company will focus on Western Canada along with the United States Gulf Coast and the U.S. Northeast and Southeast, analysts heard. “The asset base is clearly well positioned in all four of these areas and we will continue to leverage the footprint for buildable, capital efficient, higher return expansions and extensions of the system,” he said.
Responding to a question about an Alliance pipeline expansion, Yardley said the Alliance pipeline is full and it’s in a great position to take gas from either the WCSB or the Bakken. Although Enbridge tried for a long time to compete for western Canadian supply, it now is focusing more on the Bakken, he said. “We haven’t got anything quite yet germinating but we keep trying and we believe it will be a competitive project soon.”
Yardley said 2019 has been a transformational year for the company. With the settlement filing in the Texas East pipeline rate case, it has begun a period of what is likely to be several years of proceedings to true up the cost of doing business on its pipelines as it continues to make modernizing investments to set each asset up for the longer term, he said. “This model, combined with the increasing demand for natural gas in North America, makes us a sustainable portion of the Enbridge portfolio for years to come.”
North American natural gas demand over the next 20 years is expected to grow by more than 20 bcf/d in domestic markets alone with half of that for power generation while LNG exports are forecast to grow by another 15 bcf/d by 2040, analysts heard. In Western Canada, forecast demand growth is six bcf/d by 2040, mainly for industrial uses and LNG exports.

Enbridge Eyes Extension Of Value Chain To U.S. Gulf Coast | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
As it focuses its growth efforts on low capital intensity expansions and extensions of its footprint, Enbridge Inc.’s optimum goal is extending its integrated value chain all the way to the United States Gulf Coast, a company investor day in New York heard Tuesday.
 “The focus of this Gulf Coast strategy is on securing the last mile connectivity to refiners, storage terminals and export opportunities while fully developing our heavy and light crude value chain,” said Guy Jarvis, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines. A key link in the strategy is the potential to move additional heavy bbls from Flanagan South and the Seaway system, he said.
“We have been active for many years now building out our heavy crude value chain from the oilsands, to our Mainline, Flanagan South and the Seaway system to create a path that’s unparalleled in industry,” said Jarvis. “The next step is developing a strategically located terminal position on the Gulf and participating in the development of offshore VLCC (very large crude carrier) loading facilities.”
Enbridge  announced earlier this week that it and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. have agreed to jointly develop and market a deepwater offshore crude oil export terminal capable of fully loading VLCCs. The agreement would allow Enbridge an option to purchase an ownership interest in Enterprise’s Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port licence.
In addition to serving growing export markets, the terminal, along with upstream expansions, will facilitate greater market access to Canadian heavy bbls by U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, he said.
While Enbridge has looked at a number of opportunities in the Gulf, it concluded that Seaway provides it with the “best anchor position and the most connected and capital efficient approach to competitively extending our value chain,” said Jarvis.
In response to a question, he said that Enbridge and its partner are interested in securing as many long-term contracts as possible in support of the project. “Our perspective right now is that there is a base load of interest in that project right now to proceed and continue to be developed,” said Jarvis. While that would provide returns at the lower end of the expected range, they would firm up as more volumes are added.
A key feature of Enbridge’s Gulf plan is to develop its 100 per cent owned and operated terminal at Jones Creek in the Houston area. It would have up to 15 million bbls of storage connected to the Seaway refinery, delivery and distribution network with existing export dock and future facilities. The first stage could be in operation by 2022.
“Each refinery is very specific in its need for a specific crude slate and many of these refineries have spent significant dollars on a kit that’s designed to process heavy crudes or a medium sour crude,” said Vern Yu, president and chief operating officer, Liquids Pipelines. “It’s very important to think about how do you stage this crude to get the right crude to the right refinery. That’s why we think our Jones Creek terminal is going to be a very significant opportunity.”
Jones Creek, he said, will be a major hub of getting the right crude slates to the right refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast and then become a central point to stage for exports. “Ultimately as crude supply increases on the Gulf Coast it will become more important to get the most economic solution available to export that crude to the growing demand centres in Asia.”
Enbridge sees Houston as the ideal market to stage exports because all the different types of crude come into the Houston market, it’s a short distance to deepwater and the Jones Creek terminal will be there to stage these exports, analysts heard.
In response to a question about heavy crude exports, Jarvis said Enbridge believes there’s still lots of room for Canadian heavy to be consumed on the Gulf. “Whether people want to export it or not is really probably going to be targeted at ensuring they don’t create some congestion and price weakness due to the congestion of heavy bbls,” he said. “We don’t see it necessarily being a 365-day option for heavy producers to be exporting but more likely they will participate in providing partial loads to people who might be loading a bunch of light crude.”
Seaway also has recently announced an open season for an additional 200,000 bbls/d of light crude service but could consider additional capacity if there is demand for it, said Jarvis. Part of the Seaway planning is to work closely with its partner on the potential to move incremental heavy bbls on the Enbridge Mainline into the Gulf, he said.  
“In combination, these initiatives enhance and extend our value chain right from Western Canada to the Gulf, emphasizing export infrastructure,” he said.
In Canada, Enbridge expects there will be additional regional pipeline opportunities in the oilsands as producers continue to improve their cost structure and environmental footprint.  
“Enbridge’s four major oil pipelines and the Norlite diluent pipeline all have opportunities for additional throughput,” said Jarvis. The company also is well-positioned to capture new investments in any project-specific facilities needed to support expansion of existing operations or the connection of new projects, he said.
By 2030, the Canadian heavy crude share of the U.S. Gulf Coast market is forecast to rise to more than 50 per cent from roughly 30 per cent in 2018, replacing Mexican and Venezuelan heavy oil supply, he noted.
In the Bakken, Enbridge is continuing to see strong production and it is conducting an open season to secure additional volumes for transport to the U.S. Gulf Coast on the Bakken pipeline. “These projects represent singles in terms of the capital investment but are expected to swing well above their weight in terms of financial return.”
In terms of market access pipelines buildout, Enbridge is in “really good shape,” said Jarvis. The 42-inch Southern Access pipeline was sized to ensure the company would be in a position to expand and balance the Mainline at Superior, Wisconsin and the expansion to 1.1 million bbls/d is pretty much complete and ready to go when required.
The company also recently has begun discussion on emerging customer interest in a merchant terminal at Flanagan that would allow bbls to be staged from the Mainline back into downstream pipelines, he said.

"Enbridge To Add Another 100,000 Bbls/d Of Mainline Capacity In 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
After adding up to 100,000 bbls/d of additional egress out of Western Canada through Mainline optimizations in 2019, Enbridge Inc. expects to add another 50,000 bbls/d next year, also through optimization, a company investor day heard Tuesday.
The incremental capacity promised for this year was all in place as of Dec. 1 when the Canadian segment of Line 3 went into commercial operation, Guy Jarvis, executive vice-president of Liquids Pipelines, told analysts at the New York event.  The enhancements in Canada are complete, enabling Enbridge to fully optimize North Dakota and Alberta bbls at Cromer on the Mainline and the new Line 3 in Canada further helps optimize delivery windows, he said.
“With some minor capital additions to the system early in the new year, we expect another 50,000 bbls/d can be achieved on the Mainline in 2020. This is great news for our customers.”
Enbridge will continue to use drag-reducing agents (DRAs) in the system optimization and the new Line 3 will be part of that, said Jarvis. With the new Line 3 and the configuration of the new line, it also will be looking at whether there is a better way to optimize existing pump capability to eke out additional throughput.
Also, through its innovation and technology lab, an Enbridge team is working with a group of IT specialists in terms of mapping and following and optimizing exactly how bbls move in and out of company terminals, he said. “We believe that the way we are moving bbls in and out of our terminals is actually impacting our throughput to some negative degree and we are trying to solve that through an IT solution.”
An expanded Express pipeline also will add 50,000 bbls/d of egress capacity when it comes into service in the first quarter of 2021, said Jarvis. “We continue to evaluate opportunities to extend the reach of the Express system further towards Cushing [Okla.] and the Gulf and ultimately hope that might be an opportunity to link up further with our Seaway system.”
Combined, Enbridge expects throughput from Western Canada in 2020 to be 200,000 bbls/d higher than it was at the start of the fourth quarter of this year. “Each of these initiatives demonstrates that we can deliver on low-cost high-impact opportunities to grow the business and very importantly, provide additional pipeline egress for our diverse customer base,” he said.

"Keyera ‘Optimistic’ About Future Of AECO Prices, Remains Bullish On Canada | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Keyera Corp. is bullish on western Canadian natural gas fundamentals going forward and plans on continuing to focus on growing its Canadian operations, the company’s inaugural investor day heard this morning.
“There’s reason to be optimistic about the future of natural gas prices in Alberta and a lot of that is happening because of changes on TC’s [TC Energy Corporation] system,” said Dean Setoguchi, Keyera’s chief commercial officer.
“First of all, TC is allowing interruptible gas to flow into storage now. So what we’ve seen, especially over the last couple of years, is when we’ve had maintenance outages natural gas has been trading at a zero value. With this new policy of allowing gas to flow into storage, that should help stabilize the AECO gas prices.”
Setoguchi said additional natural gas egress options that will be onstream in the near- to mid-term and increased demand in Alberta are also cause for optimism regarding AECO pricing dynamics in the coming years.
“We’re seeing a lot of export capacity getting built over the next three years, both to the east and down to the west into the U.S.,” he said.
“Inter-Alberta demand is expected to increase by about 1.5 bcf a day. About half of that is related to coal-to-gas switching for the generation of power. On top of that, industrial demand is expected to increase by a half a bcf a day.”
Further out, the LNG Canada project will provide another sizeable outlet for western Canadian natural gas producers.
“When we look out into the future and into the middle of the next decade, we’re excited to see the first LNG development come online off the West Coast of Canada. And that will require about two bcf a day of gas to feed it. We hope that this is the first of many LNG developments into the future,” Setoguchi said.
Keyera expects the AECO-Henry Hub differential to strengthen which will offer further upside for AECO and demand for Keyera’s stable of infrastructure assets.
“If you look at the past 18 to 24 months there’s been a tremendous amount of volatility which means that for extended periods of time AECO has traded well below $1 per mcf. Again, it’s caused a lot of hardships for our producers,” he said.
“When you look at the forward curve it’s much flatter and it trades at a much tighter band. So again, it’s much more supportive of … stronger AECO prices and stable AECO prices. Over time, we believe this will translate to more activity behind our facilities.”
Keen on Canada
President and CEO David Smith said Keyera remains committed to pursuing current and future growth opportunities in Canada.
“We continue to believe that Keyera’s growth opportunities in Canada are robust and long term. While we will continue to pursue complimentary, high-return niche opportunities in the U.S., the focus of our strategy will continue to be on Canada and we think Canada’s oil and gas industry has a bright future,” he said.
“The quality of our oil and gas resources is competitive with most other regions around the globe. These resources have provided Canadians with an incredibly high quality of life and access to low cost, secure energy supply leads to improved living conditions and economic progress,” Smith added.
“Canada is now in a position to share this advantage with the rest of the world … the world needs our positive energy.”
Smith noted that among energy producing countries, “Canada is an ESG leader.”
“Our strong, consistently enforced environmental regulations, our methane emissions restrictions and regulations, our carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our safe pipeline transportation system, our worker safety track record, our human rights transparency and ethics, our corporate governance, to name but a few,” he said.
“So these are the reasons we’re very optimistic about the future of Canada’s oil and gas sector. We need to be cost competitive with other global sources of supply and we need to build out the infrastructure to access global markets. But we are getting these things done, perhaps a little too slowly. But with the Trans Mountain expansion, with LNG Canada, with the Coastal GasLink, TC Energy’s debottlenecking of their system in Western Canada, we are more confident about the industry’s future than we have been for a few years,” Smith added.
“I’m calling the bottom for Canadian oil and gas.”

Schedule Set For Trans Mountain Coquihalla Segment Detailed Route Hearing | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) says it anticipates it will hear written oral arguments in May 2020 on a detailed route hearing for the 47-kilometre Coquihalla segment of the Trans Mountain expansion, thus avoiding a one-year delay in the in-service date.
The commission is to issue its decision within 12 weeks after the close of the hearing.
Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC had submitted that failure to begin construction activities on the segment in June 2020 would affect the project schedule.
 Construction in the high altitudes of the Coquihalla segment can only occur during limited times of the year as tree-clearing is generally only feasible after the bird nesting window (between March 30-Aug. 17) and before heavy snow loads commence (about Nov. 30), the company said in a filing. “A delay would prejudice contractors relying on the construction schedule, Indigenous peoples and individuals that will benefit from the project’s timely completion, and the shippers that have contracted for transportation service on the expanded system,” said Trans Mountain.
The CER later will hold a detailed route hearing (Phase 2) for the 26-kilometre Coldwater Valley segment of the route after Trans Mountain has filed a hydrological report relating to the aquifer on the Coldwater Indian Reserve. Timing for the report is uncertain and the commission found that while the study which was required as a condition of the expansion approval is necessary for the detailed routing hearing, it is not relevant to the Coquihalla segment.
The Coldwater Indian Band had objected to Trans Mountain’s request that the hearing be divided into two parts as its statement of objection (SOO) relates to the entire detailed route and issues related to areas of spiritual and cultural importance relate to the entire segment and cannot easily be divided, Coldwater said in a filing.  It also said it was concerned that considering the evidence in two hearings would provide the commission with an incomplete picture related to hearing concerns and risks.
The CER, though, said the Phase 1 portion of the hearing offers an opportunity for Coldwater to present any information related to its opposition, including issues related to spiritual and cultural importance, in the manner it sees fit and that the full record will be placed into the Phase 2 record to eliminate duplication of effort.
Kingsvale pump station 
The Coldwater band also objected to Trans Mountain’s argument that it limit the geographic scope of the detailed hearing route for the Coldwater Valley segment to the east boundary of the Kingsvale pump station, the boundary prior to the Federal Court of Appeal decision which ordered a reconsideration of the project. The band had sought the inclusion of the pump station in the route hearing on the grounds that the limitation “poses unacceptable limits on routing considerations on the Coldwater Valley segment.”
The CER, however, rejected that argument, saying it would not consider a route around the pump station as an alternate route. It noted that the Kingsvale pump station, along with all other pump stations along the pipeline route, had been fully assessed during the certificate hearing. In reconsidering the approval, the National Energy Board (NEB) said it was satisfied with the pump station design, said the commission.  
In its view, routing around the pump station would require the project to be re-engineered and would result in changes to the Line 2 hydraulic characteristics, potentially producing significant changes in the line’s pump attributes, pipe diameters and pipe lengths. “Bypassing the Kingsvale pump station, with the requirement of constructing a new pump station in a new location, would constitute a significant change to the footprint and operating performance of the pipeline system from what the NEB recommended and the GIC [governor-in-council] approved,” said the CER.
In the detailed route hearing, it is up to Trans Mountain to prove that its proposed detailed route is the best possible detailed route, the regulator noted.
“If Coldwater wishes to identify another alternate route to demonstrate that Trans Mountain’s proposed detailed route is not the best possible detailed route, it must do so in advance of the oral questioning and argument portion of the hearing — either in its written evidence or as oral Indigenous knowledge,” said the commission. Consistent with that requirement, if Trans Mountain has concerns with any proposed alternate route, it must file details of its concerns in its reply evidence or supplemental reply evidence, as applicable.
While the commission will ultimately approve or deny Trans Mountain’s proposed route following a hearing, it will not be in a position to approve an alternate route through the detailed route determination process.
Review and variance
In its decision, the CER rejected Trans Mountain’s application for a review and variance of the regulator’s decision to extend the geographic scope of the detailed route hearing to include Coquihalla segment as requested by the Coldwater band in its 2019 SOO. The company argued that the Coldwater band’s statement of concern had not mentioned: any routing issues in the segment, any changes in circumstances regarding the Coquihalla segment, or any details from the additional (Phase III) consultations following the original approval of the project in May 2016.
The commission in its ruling acknowledged that Coldwater in its 2019 SOO did not specifically indicate that reinitiated Phase III consultations had taken place with respect to detailed routing issues for the Coquihalla segment. However, it said, “The Commission is of the view that it is appropriate to apply its resumption decision generously in this case in light of its constitutional duties.”

Oral Indigenous Knowledge Hearings Underway On NGTL North Corridor Expansion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) this week is hearing oral Indigenous knowledge on an application from NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) for the 81-kilometre North Corridor expansion project in northwestern Alberta.
Eight Indigenous communities are expected to appear before the commission at its Peace River hearing.
The commission says it recognizes that Indigenous peoples have an oral tradition for sharing knowledge from generation to generation that cannot always be shared meaningfully in writing. Indigenous knowledge can provide relevant information to the commission, including information that may otherwise have been unavailable, it says.
The hearings began Monday and will run until Thursday at the Chateau Nova in Peace River. There also will be a live audio broadcast.

Enbridge Line 3 Oil Pipeline Clears Hurdles With Minnesota Regulator | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 pipeline replacement cleared important hurdles on Monday when a Minnesota regulator endorsed a revised environmental impact statement for the project.
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s decision, followed by its approval of a certificate of need and route permit, is a victory for Canadian oil producers, who have been forced to curtail production in Alberta because of a shortage of pipeline capacity.
Line 3, built in the 1960s, carries oil from Alberta to Superior, Wis. It carries less oil than it was designed for because of age and corrosion.
“Instead of a 50-plus year-old pipeline with known integrity issues, a new pipeline would replace it,” Enbridge lawyer Eric Swanson said.
Line 3’s opponents, however, questioned the need for replacing the pipeline amid concerns about fossil fuels.
“If Enbridge is talking about an integrity problem, shut it down,” Joe Plummer, representing the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, told the commission.
Replacing Line 3 would allow Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge to double capacity to 760,000 bbls/d.
“This [decision] is critically important because when we get that extra shipment capacity we should be able to keep our energy market in balance,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said on Twitter.
The Minnesota Department of Commerce revised its environmental impact statement for Line 3 after the Minnesota Court of Appeal ruled last June that the original statement was insufficient regarding a single issue – assessment of a potential spill on Lake Superior and its watershed.
The department opposed issuing a certificate of need, however, saying Enbridge had not provided a forecast for energy demand as required.
A spill would be “catastrophic” to the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe indigenous community, including its wild rice harvesting, said Benjamin Benoit, the group's environmental director.
Oil can also spill if it travels by rail, the main alternative to pipelines, said Kevin Pranis, a spokesman for Laborers International Union of North America, which supports the project because of the jobs it would create.
Line 3 still requires various permits and its opponents are expected to formally petition the Minnesota commission to reconsider its decisions. The Sierra Club said in a statement that it would continue to fight Line 3 alongside other groups.
The project is one of three, along with TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL and the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain, that have been stalled for years by opposition.

Comments Sought On Gazoduq’s Proposed Pipeline Draft Impact Statement Guidelines | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (IAAC) is seeking comments on Gazoduq Inc.’s proposal for a natural gas pipeline that would transport western Canadian natural gas approximately 780 kilometres from northeastern Ontario to an LNG facility at Saguenay, Que. export.
The proposed project is a 42-inch pipeline designed to transport about 1.8 bcf/d of gas approximately from an interconnection with TC Energy Corporation’s existing mainline near Ramore, Ont. to a future natural gas liquefaction, storage and export facility (Énergie Saguenay) belonging to its main customer, GNL Québec Inc.
As part of the planning phase of the impact assessment, the public and Indigenous Peoples are being invited to review and provide feedback on the draft tailored impact statement guidelines and the draft public participation plan. The draft guidelines outline the project-specific factors that will be considered in the assessment and provide direction to Gazoduq on the information and studies required in its impact statement. The draft public participation plan explains how the public will be engaged throughout the review process.
The IAA will accept online comments to its registry until March 10, 2020. All comments received will be published online as part of the project file.
Community meetings will be held during the consultation period with both the Agency and Canada Energy Regulator (CER) available to provide information and answer questions.
As next steps, the agency will consider all input received and finalize the public participation plan and the tailored impact statement guidelines which will be posted to its registry. The IAA also will post the notice of commencement for the project and start the impact statement phase. This project will benefit from several other opportunities for the public and Indigenous peoples to participate throughout the impact assessment process.
The proposed project is a designated project under the agency’s physical activities regulations and would be regulated by the CER. The integrated impact assessment for this project is a single assessment through a review panel process that would meet the requirements of both the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy Regulator Act.

"Enbridge Line 3 Oil Pipeline Clears Hurdle, Minnesota Regulator Rules Environment Statement Adequate | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — A Minnesota regulator on Monday ruled that a revised environmental impact statement for Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 oil pipeline replacement is adequate, helping the long-delayed project clear a significant hurdle.
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted 3-1 to find the revised statement from the state's Department of Commerce adequate, and was to move on Monday afternoon to consider reissuing a certificate of need and route permit for the project.
Line 3, built in the 1960s, carries oil from Alberta to Superior, Wis. Because of age and corrosion, it carries less oil than it was designed to transport.
Enbridge has argued that replacing it will reduce the chances of leaks.
Replacing Line 3 would allow Enbridge to double its capacity to 760,000 bbls/d, providing relief to congested pipelines carrying Canada’s oil.
The Minnesota Department of Commerce revised its environmental impact statement for the project after the Minnesota Court of Appeal ruled last June that the original statement was insufficient. The court found the original statement lacking regarding a single issue, assessment of a potential spill on Lake Superior and its watershed.

"More Information Needed In Enbridge Firm Service Filing, Says Suncor | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Suncor Energy Inc. wants to see more information from Enbridge Inc., which has filed an application seeking regulatory approval to convert up to 90 per cent of its Canadian Mainline capacity to contract service.
At this point, it appears that Enbridge has not provided sufficient information to the CER for it to determine whether an application for contract service on the Canadian Mainline is in the public interest and that the tolls are just and reasonable, says Suncor in comments filed with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER).
The pipeline company should be required to file detailed information on tolls and tariffs as stipulated in the National Energy Board (now CER) filing manual, says Suncor. That information includes total cost of service, including operating maintenance and administrative expenses, depreciation, income taxes, return on rate base and other items.
Although the Enbridge application also seeks approval of firm service and spot tolls, it does not include any methodology by which those tolls were determined, says the oilsands producer.
Enbridge filed its Mainline contracting application in response to an earlier CER decision which halted its open season. The regulator ruled the company could not offer firm service to prospective Mainline shippers until the commission had approved the change from common carrier service, including all associated tolls and conditions of service.
The decision was in response to a complaint from Suncor as well as submissions from Shell Canada Limited, the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) and Canadian Natural Resources Limited.
At that time, the commission also indicated that ""any future regulatory proceeding following an Enbridge application for firm service would provide an appropriate public forum for all interested persons to share information regarding Mainline firm service,” says Suncor. “The Enbridge application triggers such a proceeding.”
In Suncor’s view, a major issue is whether the proposed tolls are “above a competitive, cost-reflective level” and therefore represent an exercise by Enbridge of its market power in providing transportation services from Western Canada to ex-basin markets.
The company says that in its earlier application it relied on expert evidence to assert that Enbridge possesses market power and that, “absent evidence that the tolls and terms specified by Enbridge for firm service are justified on the basis of underlying cost, the contract carriage conversion proposal represented an exercise of that market power.”  The Enbridge application, says Suncor, presents essentially the same contract carriage proposal to the CER for approval.
The filing for approval of firm service does not eliminate the market power issue, Suncor argues. “Rather, it places the responsibility on the commission to determine whether the proposed tolls and other terms and conditions of service reflect an exercise of market power by Enbridge.”
Information on the underlying costs of Enbridge providing firm service on the Mainline “can and should inform the commission's decision on the market power issue,” it says.
Regulated companies such as Enbridge that are seeking adjudication of a tolls and tariffs matter are required to meet the detailed information requirements of the filing manual. Alternatively, a company can come to the regulator for approval of a negotiated settlement, subject to guidelines.
The Enbridge application, though, makes no effort to comply with either the filing manual requirements or the settlement guidelines and in fact, mentions neither, says Suncor.
“Instead, it seeks to have the CER accept entry by Enbridge to the regulatory process through a third door, being an application that is presented as a ‘black box’ package that is the product of bilateral negotiations that resulted in the support of a select number of Canadian Mainline shippers,” it says. “Suncor is not aware that such an approach has previously been accepted or considered by the CER or its predecessor.”
In its comments, Suncor urges the regulator to implement a full oral hearing process to consider the application. “The matters at issue in this proceeding are critical for Mainline shippers and other interested parties,” it says. “The result of approval of the application would be a revolutionary change in access to capacity to transport oil out of the WCSB.”
In these circumstances, it says, “an efficient, appropriate and fair hearing process would be one that allows for a full and complete consideration of the critical issues that are relevant to the CER decision.”
The Enbridge filing has attracted considerable interest with more than 50 comments from different parties including producers, marketers, refiners, a producer association and the Alberta and Saskatchewan governments.
Two stage process
A number of commenters have proposed a two-stage process in which the CER would first determine whether the application is consistent with Enbridge’s common carrier requirements under the Canada Energy Regulator Act. Only if the conversion is approved would the regulator proceed to the next step which would include a review of the more detailed aspects of the application including tolls, tariffs and conditions of service.
Such an approach would increase regulatory efficiency and enable participation from a wider range of stakeholders, according to some of those who commented on the process.
However, BP Products North America Inc. disagrees that the application should be considered in two parts which it says would no doubt result in two hearings, both of which would include a comment process, information requests, evidence, an oral hearing, and argument.
 “If accepted, this would be a largely duplicative process, which, having regard to the number of parties involved, would be unnecessarily costly and cumbersome,” it says. “Respectfully, regulatory efficiency would not be served by a split process, but would instead result in significant delay and uncertainty for the foreseeable future for all parties.
BP, along with some other parties, also emphasized the need for the regulatory proceeding to be completed in a timely manner to provide time for an open season to meet the targeted July 1, 2021 implementation following the expiry of the  existing Competitive Toll Settlement which is due to expire June 30, 2021.

Enbridge CEO Previews ‘Public Interest Test’ Arguments For Mainline Contracting Initiative | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The chief executive officer of Enbridge Inc. outlined Thursday how the company believes its new contracting proposal for the Mainline pipeline system meets the public interest test.
The company has filed an application with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) seeking approval to convert up to 90 per cent of its Canadian Mainline capacity to contract service.
Enbridge filed its Mainline contracting application in response to an earlier CER decision that halted its open season. The regulator ruled the company could not offer firm service to prospective Mainline shippers until it had approved the change from common carrier service, including all associated tolls and conditions of service.
“It’s important for everyone to understand what we’re delivering here with this proposal is exactly what we’ve heard from our shippers,” Al Monaco told the CIBC Western Institutional Investor Conference on Thursday.
Monaco said shippers want guaranteed access through the Enbridge system, as well as toll stability.
“We designed it in consultation with our shippers over the last two years and of course many of them are entirely prepared to sign up. They said that in our application and over 75 per cent of our current shippers support the deal.”
Monaco spoke against the backdrop of a week that’s seen more public announcements of opposition to the company’s proposal.
Canadian Natural Resources Limited said in a filing with the CER on Tuesday that Enbridge’s bid to change the Mainline from monthly service to long-term contracts is an abuse of market power and isn’t in the public interest. The producer asked the regulator to split its review of the proposal into two parts, with the first addressing whether the conversion should even be allowed.
On the same day, the Explorers & Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) also asked the CER to split the review process in two. The regulator should address other matters in Enbridge’s application, such as tolls, only once the fundamental issue of a switch to contract service is decided, EPAC said.
Yesterday, Baytex Energy Corp. announced at the CIBC conference that it also plans to voice its objections to the CER about Enbridge’s plans to change its contracting approach.
For its part, Suncor Energy Inc. wants to see more information from Enbridge. In comments filed with the regulator, Suncor said it appears that Enbridge has not provided sufficient information to the CER for it to determine whether an application for contract service on the Canadian Mainline is in the public interest and that the tolls are just and reasonable.
Outlining arguments for the public interest test 
During a discussion at the CIBC conference, Monaco listed several ways in which the new contracting proposal meets the public interest test.
It can first be framed within the context of why this is good for the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, said Monaco.
“And I think it comes down to one simple thing: it’s the netback pricing that comes from the lowest tolls of any system to the best markets.” Under the new regime, he said, tolls would have a similar profile.
Monaco noted that Western Canada crude is “essentially priced off the marginal barrel at variable cost.”
He added: “Once you have pipeline contracts in place, and you have fixed costs, then your next barrel moves based on incremental variable costs — in this case, the price of power for a pipeline like ours. So what happens is, the netback pricing should improve … because the fixed costs that are sunk are out of the equation and that last barrel that moves is setting that price.”
A second reason why the new contracting proposal meets the public interest test relates to demand pull, Monaco said.
Because Enbridge moves about 60 per cent of the line’s volume into the “best markets,” he said this creates demand pull for western Canadian supply.
“You’re ‘demand pulling’ right into the best refining complex in North America, and the most competitive refining complex in the world if you look at it on a per-unit basis. So you’ve got 13 million barrels essentially in the Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and other areas that we are attaching the western Canadian basin to. So I think that’s positive.”
The public interest test will also be assessed on whether the offer is fair — in general that comes down to Enbridge ensuring it is providing open access to everybody, Monaco said.
“We went to great lengths in this proposal to make sure every producer — no matter how big or small — had an option to be involved,” including any term shippers wanted, whether it was take-or-pay (or not), as well as toll discounting applied on how much volume a shipper was committing to.”
Lastly, Monaco said “unlocking the commercial model” for the Mainline will help “unlock more capability and resources for the producing and refining community — downstream and upstream — for a long period of time. Once you’ve got the contracting structure in place, then you know the economics for expansion, and you know how to toll that next barrel from there.”
Once the new contracting mechanism is set up, and if the company can complete Line 3 in the U.S., “all of a sudden then, you’ve got more opportunity to get barrels into the U.S. Gulf Coast, and through the Mid-Continent as well,” Enbridge’s chief executive said. “You look at the regional picture and the opportunity set here, having that commercial structure just opens up all kinds of opportunities.”
He noted both the Flanagan South and Seaway pipelines have “a lot of expandability.”
“And as everyone knows, when you’re dealing with incremental expansions, whether it’s DRA, or whether it’s pumping capacity, all of a sudden it’s very highly economic.
“And I think at the end of the day, if you look at the North American supply/demand outlook for the future, it’s really going to be driven by exports. So our system is in a great position to capture low-cost expandability with a structure like this, so we can get barrels to the Gulf Coast.”
Producers then have an option, he said. They can “hit” the eight million bbls/d of refining capacity, about half of which is heavy, which is ideal for Canadian crude. “But the big opportunity is in the export markets.”
Different interests
When asked how Enbridge plans to approach parties who are not aligned or that have different interests, Monaco re-emphasized that the company “didn’t come up with this ourselves. We spent a lot of time with those exact same parties, actually coming up with a proposal that would be the best for the entire basin.”
 Monaco said some of those parties may be supporting other pipelines. Others may wish to have a lower toll — “no surprise there.”
“You’ve got parties that may just like to have the free option that they’ve had … but when you really get down to it, as I said earlier, over 75 per cent of current throughput is actually supporting this mechanism….”
Noting that there are “some different points of view out there,” Monaco said he couldn’t remember a time in history that the Canadian industry was all on the same page. “So I think it’s not that surprising that we’re seeing a little bit of noise here.”

New Talks Planned Over Coastal Gaslink | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– Leaders of a First Nation in northern British Columbia who say they’ll never consent to a natural gas pipeline through their traditional territory have agreed to seven days of meetings with the province.
The Office of the Wet’suwet’en issued a statement Thursday afternoon on behalf of eight hereditary chiefs saying they have agreed to the discussions in an effort to de-escalate the dispute over the Coastal GasLink pipeline.
“The hereditary chiefs maintain their commitment to peace and will pursue all avenues available to achieve a peaceful resolution,” it says.
The premier’s office also welcomed the meetings as an opportunity for all parties to work in good faith together.
The chiefs have asked for a face-to-face meeting with Premier John Horgan while declining to speak with him on the phone.
But deputy communications director George Smith said the premier will not be sitting at the table.
He said Indigenous Relations Minister Scott Fraser will lead the provincial team, while former New Democrat MP Nathan Cullen will be the “neutral” liaison between parties.
Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with 20 elected First Nations along the pipeline’s 670-kilometre route from northeastern B.C. to an export terminal in Kitimat but the hereditary clan chiefs say it has no authority without their consent.
The B.C. Supreme Court granted the company an injunction on Dec. 31. The order called for the removal of any obstructions including cabins and gates on any roads, bridges or work sites the company has been authorized to use.
It also gives authorization to the RCMP to arrest and remove anyone police have “reasonable or probable grounds” to believe has knowledge of the order and is contravening it.
The enforcement of a previous injunction a year ago resulted in the arrests of 14 people.
The RCMP said before the agreement was reached on Thursday, “efforts with respect to logistics and resource deployments had been scheduled in support of anticipated police enforcement.”
Police said they will respect the talks and not take action to enforce the injunction by removing obstructions on the Morice West Forest Service Road leading to the company's work sites.
“While additional resources may be noted in the Smithers-Houston area, the resources will be on standby during the seven-day period,” the statement says.
Earlier Thursday, the hereditary clan chiefs and their supporters called for a public investigation into the way the RCMP are controlling access along the road.
The RCMP have said they set up a checkpoint along the Morice West Forest Service Road south of Houston to prevent the dispute from escalating after patrol officers discovered hazards along the road.
But the chiefs along with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs allege that the Mounties are unlawfully restricting access on Wet'suwet'en traditional territory.
“We cannot be criminalized for using our law to access our lands, our foods, our medicine, our way of life,” said Chief Na'moks, who dialled into a news conference in Vancouver.
The coalition has submitted a complaint to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, asking the chairperson to initiate a policy complaint and public interest investigation.
Harsha Walia, executive director of the civil liberties association, said the application of the RCMP’s enforcement at the checkpoint has been “inconsistent, arbitrary and discriminatory.'”
Walia said the coalition has submitted eight first-hand accounts from people turned away as part of the complaint. Some were told only lawyers licensed to practise in B.C. would be allowed through, or only hereditary chiefs on a pre-approved list.
“RCMP officers at the checkpoint have cited a range of inconsistent and shifting policies and procedures to those who are turned away,” she told the news conference.
“Most of these do not in any way correlate to the stated goal of public safety.”
Officers check and record the identification of each person who arrives at the checkpoint, she said.
Irina Ceric, a non-practising lawyer who tried to visit supporters at a camp beyond the checkpoint, said she was turned away one day because she didn’t have a two-way radio and tire chains but she was allowed through the next day with no questions from a different officer about her equipment.
No one from the RCMP was available for an interview Thursday, but spokeswoman Janelle Shoihet said in an email that the Mounties have shared their protocol with the hereditary chiefs.
“The checkpoint was established to address safety concerns relating to the hazards including fallen trees, gasoline caches and tire piles that were intentionally placed along the roadway,” she said.
Officers at the checkpoint are also trying to prevent further escalation of “the ongoing breach” of the injunction, she said.
The protocol allows for the entry of hereditary chiefs, elected chiefs and government officials, lawyers registered to practise law with the Law Society of B.C., and other persons providing food, medicine or other supplies and services required for the well-being and safety of persons behind the blockades, Shoihet said.
The RCMP has made significant efforts to document and record all decisions and interactions at the checkpoint and are fully prepared to participate in any public complaint process, she said.

Stalled $1 Billion Gas Pipe Gets Backing From U.S. Regulator | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — A controversial $1 billion shale gas pipeline that’s been stalled by a dispute over whether it can seize state-owned land for construction won the backing of the nation’s top energy regulator.
PennEast had sought the support of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) after a court decision prevented it from exercising eminent domain in New Jersey. Its developers – which include Enbridge Inc. and Southern Co. – argued the ruling overturned 80 years of industry practice.
On Thursday, the energy commission voted 2-1 in favour of PennEast’s petition, lending the project support as it prepares to take its case to the nation’s highest court.
“The commission’s order rejecting the court’s interpretation strengthens PennEast’s forthcoming petition to the Supreme Court,” Patricia Kornick, a spokeswoman for the project, said by email.
But the project’s viability “remains on life support,” Guggenheim Securities analyst Shahriar Pourreza said Thursday in a note to clients.
“Headwinds remain material to get a project through a state that appears to be anti natural gas due to Governor Murphy’s policies,” Pourreza said, referring to New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.
FERC chairman Neil Chatterjee said at the agency’s meeting that the earlier court ruling has the “potential to disrupt the commission’s regulation of the natural gas industry” and that Thursday’s order would provide clarity for other potential litigants. The “text, legislative history and precedent” of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 reflect Congress’s intent to delegate the authority to condemn state property to pipeline certificate holders, he argued.
But Democrat Commissioner Rich Glick, the sole dissenter, criticized the regulator’s decision as “both deeply troubling and frankly, a discredit to this agency.”
The ruling also drew an angry rebuke from New Jersey Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “For an independent regulatory agency to help a private party seize state lands, all in order to build a pipeline, is as wrong as it is bizarre,” he said in a statement.
The 193-kilometre PennEast line would carry about 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day, enough for 4.7 million homes, from Pennsylvania to New Jersey.

"Baytex Will Voice Objections To Enbridge Plan, Conference Hears | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Baytex Energy Corp. plans to voice its objections to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) about plans by Enbridge Inc. to change the contracting approach it uses to move crude on its pipeline network, a conference heard on Thursday.
“We think it’s unfair,” Ed LaFehr, CEO and president of Baytex, told the 23rd annual CIBC Western Institutional Investor Conference being held in Banff. He added: “Most of the companies at this conference” would be harmed by the approach.
Baytex is not alone in opposing the plan.
For instance, Canadian Natural Resources Limited has called the planned move an abuse of market power.
There are signs Enbridge hasn’t sold producers on its plan, which has already been delayed after a bidding process for space on the line was halted. That delay forced Enbridge to submit its full plan for review by regulators.
“The proposed conversion of the Mainline from common carriage to contract carriage is unprecedented and inconsistent with the common carriage obligations established in the CER Act,” CNRL said, in opposing the plan.
Enbridge has said it held 18 months of talks with various shippers and its plan represents a compromise.
The company is seeking to be able to lock in customers into contracts as long as 20 years, a shift from the current system in which space is allocated on a monthly basis.
The Explorers & Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) has also come out in opposition to the plan by Enbridge. 
Baytex, which produces from the Eagle Ford in the U.S., the Viking, the Duvernay and heavy oil properties in the Peace River area, with total production of about 95,000 bbls/d, would be one of many producers harmed by the Enbridge plan, LaFehr said.
He said about 40 per cent of its heavy oil production is moved by rail, which gives it a degree of protection against the Enbridge plan. However, he added that smaller producers like his firm would definitely be affected.
“We just want a fair share of the egress out of the country,” he said, adding that that would not occur under the Enbridge plan, which would favour larger producers.
Enbridge said it is reviewing the filings submitted to the CER.
“We will provide a response to the CER by the required timeline of noon on February 7, 2020,” Enbridge said.
The company added: “Mainline contracting is being done in response to customer requests to have the same services on the Mainline that are available on competing pipelines — contracted service offerings with priority access and long-term toll certainty.
“We have received support from shippers representing in excess of 70 per cent of the Mainline’s current throughput.”
Enbridge said that this support comes from a wide cross-section of existing and prospective producing and refining shippers including Cenovus Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Limited, BP plc, Vermilion Energy Inc., Citgo, United Refining, LyondellBasell, Flint Hills, Marathon, Motiva, PBF, Coffeyville Resources and HollyFrontier.
Baytex financing
LaFehr also told those attending the conference that his company’s recent private placement bond offering, which helped it to raise US$500 million, was well-timed.
“We’re pleased it has been done,” he said.
He said the notes, issued at a rate of 8.75 per cent per annum, would have been very difficult to execute in today’s market, because the coronavirus has made it difficult to raise financing for any but gold-plated borrowers.
LaFehr said any but prime credit borrowers in the U.S. “now face a falling knife” because of concerns about the virus and the impact on the energy sector.
The Baytex CEO said it was challenging raising the cash, given concerns among U.S. lenders about the Canadian oilpatch.
“They were concerned about [pipeline] egress from Canada,” he said. But the company’s Eagle Ford assets were well known by U.S. lenders, which raised its profile.

Enbridge Mainline Proposal Gets Pushback From Top Producer | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Enbridge Inc.’s proposal to convert its Mainline crude pipeline network to long-term contracts is hitting a fresh round of opposition, with a large oil producer asking regulators to reject the plan.
Canadian Natural Resources Limited said in a filing with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) on Tuesday that Enbridge’s bid to change the Mainline from monthly service to long-term contracts is an abuse of market power and isn’t in the public interest. The producer asked the regulator to split its review of the proposal into two parts, with the first addressing whether the conversion should even be allowed.
The opposition signals that Enbridge hasn’t yet sold some producers on its plan, which already has been delayed after a bidding process for space on the line was halted. That halt required Enbridge to submit its full plan for review by regulators last month, and Canadian Natural is now asking the CER to reject it outright.
“The proposed conversion of the Mainline from common carriage to contract carriage is unprecedented and inconsistent with the common carriage obligations established in the CER Act,” Calgary-based Canadian Natural said in the filing.
Enbridge said in an emailed statement it’s reviewing the filing submitted by Canadian Natural and will provide a response to CER by Feb. 7, adding that its proposal has received support from companies representing over 70 per cent of the Mainline’s current throughput. The pipeline operator has previously said its proposal to the CER represents 18 months of discussions with a variety of shippers and is the best compromise of their competing views.
Enbridge is seeking to be able to lock customers on the Mainline into contracts for as long as 20 years, a shift from the current system in which space is allocated on a monthly basis. The company has said long-term contracts will provide shippers with certainty on tolls and market access.
The Explorers & Producers Association of Canada (EPAC), which represents mostly small- and mid-sized producers, also asked the CER on Tuesday to split the review process in two. The regulator should address other matters in Enbridge’s application, such as tolls, only once the fundamental issue of a switch to contract service is decided.
“The Enbridge application is proposing a monumental change that has the potential to change the face of Canadian oil markets for decades,” EPAC president Tristan Goodman said in its filing. “Therefore, the preliminary issue of the appropriateness of converting the Enbridge Mainline to firm service should be carefully considered as a threshold question by a process that is efficient, inclusive and consistent with the public interest.”

Trans Mountain Route Hearings Resume | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Beginning today, the commission of the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) will hold detailed route hearings for landowners along the path of the Trans Mountain expansion project.
The hearings are the first since regulatory processes on the project resumed in July 2019.
Detailed route hearings are required where an objection to the detailed route exists, and allow the commission to decide whether the exact location of the pipeline is the best possible, and to confirm the most appropriate methods and timing of construction. Landowners whose lands are proposed to be crossed by the pipeline, as well as Indigenous groups and other persons whose lands may be adversely affected were able to object to the detailed route proposed by Trans Mountain.
The commission granted detailed route hearings where material changes in circumstances were identified since 2018, or where hearings had been granted but not completed prior to the court decision stopping the project in 2018.
The Canadian federal government re-approved the 1,147 kilometre pipeline project, including its approximately 150 metre-wide pipeline corridor, in June 2019. Currently, 68 per cent of the pipeline’s detailed route has been approved. Announcements of further detailed route hearings for the pipeline stretching southwest past Kamloops and into British Columbia’s Lower Mainland region are expected shortly.
Construction is permitted in areas where applicable conditions have been satisfied and the detailed route of the pipeline has been approved. Pipeline construction is currently underway along Alberta portions, as well as at the Edmonton and Burnaby terminals and the Westridge Marine Terminal.

"More Rail Investment Needed, And No Pipe Would Mean Even More Required: CERI | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Rail in Canada requires investments of around $5 billion over the next five years to accommodate expected growth in demand, including crude freights, forecasts the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI).
“That’s investment pertaining specifically to the rail supply chain, which if you look at what those components are, this includes the physical track, obviously, and all the supporting infrastructure around the terminals, around the short lines,” Dinara Millington, vice-president of research, told the Bulletin following a recent presentation on the role of rail in Canada’s crude and petrochemical markets.
Overall, CERI expects freight weight moved by rail will increase 14 per cent between 2018 and 2025, with the top five commodity groups transported via rail being agriculture, petrochemicals, coal, minerals and forest products. “Can the rail system withstand this incremental volume without additional investment? We don’t think so.”
Further, Millington said during last week’s presentation, the CERI forecast assumes the completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, Line 3 and Keystone XL projects. If these pipeline additions do not happen, then there will be a 66.25 per cent growth in crude-by-rail demand by 2025 (compared to 2018), which would impact the overall expected growth in rail demand.
“We’re foreseeing those volumes will be reaching 700,000 bbls per day [without pipelines]. If those pipelines are built, we’re still going to see some crude being moved by rail, but it won’t be anywhere in these significant volumes.”
Along with the presentation last week, CERI will soon be releasing a report on this topic of rail transportation. Millington noted that rail investments can improve and boost the economic development in many sectors across the national and provincial economies.
“We’re not just looking at petrochemicals and we’re not just looking at crude oil, but we’re looking at the full suite of [commodities] being produced across this country.”
Supply chain challenges
Following stakeholder interviews as part of its research, CERI identified several-supply chain challenges on the country’s rail network, including delays and network congestion, especially pertaining to “the first mile and last mile” of railway shipments. This can be caused by railcars not arriving in port on time, meaning the ships charge for waiting, or other matters of poor co-ordination of the full supply-chain logistics.
“Overall, the full system needs to be re-evaluated in how it operates and how it talks to one another,” Millington said. “We found it’s very fragmented. There are shippers in silos. Rail companies are occupying their own networks and terminals and ports.”
She added: “We need to have a more holistic approach when it comes to the Canadian rail network and the full logistics system.”
Better data required
Another stakeholder-identified challenge would be the difficulty of measuring rail performance due to the use of different and inconsistent metrics in Canada, according to the CERI researcher.
“We feel the quality of data needs to improve,” Millington said, suggesting data should be available in much more detail than is currently the case, and not just at the national level or provincial level. “When we tried to assess some of the congestion at terminals, routes or corridors, some of the reasons we weren’t really able to quantify the congestion is simply because we didn’t have the data.”
She added: “We feel by establishing some sort of performance metrics that everyone would use would ease some of the tension within the stakeholders. We feel that in order to measure rail capacity and congestion areas, we need to have better data.”

Jordan Cove Withdraws Application For Removal/Fill Permit | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Jordan Cove Energy Project, LP and Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline L.P. are withdrawing the removal/fill application filed with the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL).
The DSL was notified of the withdrawal in a letter from Jordan Cove. Oregon’s removal/fill permit rules allow applicants to withdraw an application at any time prior to the permit decision. DSL expected to make a decision Jan. 31 on Jordan Cove’s application, per the department’s letter of Jan. 21.
Removal/fill permits are required for projects that remove or fill more than 50 cubic yards of material in waters of the state or in wetlands. The application withdrawn by Jordan Cove included removal/fill activity related to construction of the proposed LNG terminal, slip and access channel, and pipeline.
When a removal/fill permit application is withdrawn, the application fee is forfeited and the application file is closed. A new application must be submitted for a project to receive any further consideration.
Jordan Cove’s letter did not indicate whether submission of a new removal/fill permit application is planned, the DSL stated.

Keystone XL Wins Green Light From U.S. to Plow Ahead on Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — TC Energy Corporation’s long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline took another step forward with U.S. approval of a key stretch of construction.
The Interior Department authorized construction across a swath of federal land in Montana, according to a release on Wednesday.
While approval by the oil-friendly Trump administration was expected, the move is a sign of growing momentum for a project that ground to a halt under federal opposition in 2015.
“This is another important step as we advance towards building this important energy infrastructure project,'’ TC spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email.
Progress on Keystone XL, which will boost shipments of crude from Alberta’s oilsands to Gulf Coast refineries, is a welcome sign for a Canadian energy industry that has been hamstrung by a too little pipeline capacity. The pipeline pinch has weighed on local crude prices and stunted explorers’ expansion plans.
But the $8 billion pipeline isn’t in the clear just yet. It’s still the subject of a legal challenge in Montana, and additional federal permits are still necessary.

Sask. Introduces Electronic Pipeline Registry | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Government of Saskatchewan is modernizing and strengthening its regulatory oversight of oil and gas pipeline infrastructure in the province.
The government announced the proclamation of Pipelines Amendment Act, 2019, which is the culmination of several years of work. The introduction of an electronic pipeline registry forms part of this work.
 “The introduction of substantial enhancements to our pipeline licensing system will also provide more efficiency and regulatory certainty for our oil and gas sector,” said Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre.
In recent years, the province has enhanced regulatory systems to monitor and review pipeline construction and operations, with more stringent inspection, investigation, penalty and audit powers. 
The new act and regulations will expand regulatory oversight to include retroactive licensing of approximately 80,000 flowlines across the province over the next four years and more stringent scrutiny of applications at higher-risk locations, such as waterways.  With these changes, the ministry of energy and resources has fully addressed all outstanding issues raised by the provincial auditor regarding the integrity and safety of pipelines in Saskatchewan.
This is the first system of its kind in Canada to adopt an entirely electronic registry of pipeline licensing and administration, the province said.  The act establishes a new module in the Integrated Resource Information System (IRIS) for an online license registry, similar to the Saskatchewan Land Titles Registry, which will issue and administer licenses for the oil, gas and mining sectors.
 “In developing the pipeline regulatory framework, the Government of Saskatchewan worked to ensure both regulatory efficiency and predictability for operators,” said Brad Herald, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) vice-president of Western Canada Operations.  “The new pipeline module, with its online licensing registry, highlights the province’s commitment to monitoring and upholding the highest standards of safety for the public and the environment; standards that are also continuing priorities for industry.”
The new system will also streamline the review of applications and reduce the time required for routine approvals, the government said.  In addition, the introduction of administrative penalties will complete the overall compliance framework tied to pipeline regulation. 
The Pipelines Administration and Licensing Regulations are now in effect, along with Directive PNG034: Saskatchewan Pipelines Code, which clarifies and enhances requirements set out in previous regulations.

"Kinder Morgan Profit, Cash Flow Rise On Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Strength | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — U.S. pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc reported a 26 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, benefiting from higher gas takeaway from the Permian Basin through its Gulf Coast Express pipeline.
The pipeline, which can transport two billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), came into service in September when drillers were burning off natural gas at record rates due to lack of transportation capacity from the shale-rich Permian Basin.
Earnings from natural gas transport volumes rose 14 per cent and from NGL transport volumes jumped 23 per cent from a year earlier.
The pipeline operator generated $1.35 billion, or 59 cents per share, in distributable cash flow (DCF) in the fourth quarter, higher than $1.14 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, DCF rose six per cent.
Investors have been pushing U.S. oil and gas pipeline operators to deliver positive free cash flow as low energy prices and idle shale rigs pressure earnings.
The Houston-based company, whose business includes storage terminals as well as pipelines, said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $610 million, or 27 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $483 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.
However, the company’s weighted average natural gas liquids (NGL) price for the quarter fell 19 per cent to $5.34 a barrel, and the realized weighted average crude oil price fell 10 per cent to $49.90/bbl.
It said profit was partly hurt by weakness in its CO2 segment, which ships carbon dioxide to oilfields where it is used to extract crude, due to lower production and volatile oil prices.
Kinder Morgan continues to speak with potential partners to develop a third natural gas pipeline, Permian Pass, but market demand has cooled after U.S. oil producers began to tighten spending last year, chief executive Steven Kean told investors.
The company could have made a final investment decision on the third pipeline of 2 billion cubic feet per day last year had the oil industry not eased spending and output projections, he said.
Still, with crude oil flowing now freely on new lines from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast, demand for natural gas transport capacity could rise eventually, Kean added. “People do recognize additional gas takeaway is going to be needed,” he said.
Excluding one-time items, Kinder Morgan earned 26 cents, missing the Street’s view by a cent, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Indigenous LNG Supporters Chide Human Rights Advocates Over Pipeline Comments | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — A collective of First Nations who support the liquefied natural gas industry in British Columbia say human rights advocates failed to do their research when they called for a pipeline project to be halted.
The First Nations LNG Alliance has issued open letters to the B.C. human rights commissioner and the United Nations Committee to End Racial Discrimination over statements they made about the Coastal GasLink project.
They called for the project to be stopped in the face of opposition from Wet’suwet’en hereditary clan chiefs who say the project has no authority without their consent.
Both said the free, prior and informed consent of all affected Indigenous groups should be granted before any project is allowed to proceed.
Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with 20 elected First Nation councils along the pipeline's 670-kilometre path but the Wet’suwet’en chiefs say within their territory, those councils only administer small reserves and it's the hereditary chiefs who hold jurisdiction over a broader area covering 22,000 square kilometres.
Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations Alliance, says in the letter to commissioner Kasari Govender that the pipeline was approved through a democratic process that Indigenous people participated in freely, and neither the committee nor commissioner consulted supportive Indigenous groups before taking a position.
No one could be reached for comment at the UN committee and Govender was not available for an interview Tuesday.
“It is disheartening to see that the input from 20 First Nations, who participated extensively during five years of consultation on the pipeline, and have successfully negotiated agreements with Coastal GasLink, is so easily dismissed by the B.C. Human Rights Commission,” Ogen-Toews says in one of the open letters.
Ogen-Toews was elected chief of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation representing 255 members on and off reserve lands for six years. The Wet’suwet’en First Nation covers a smaller area than the Wet’suwet’en Nation over which the hereditary clan chiefs claim authority.
The letter accuses Govender of ignoring the social and economic benefits already realized by workers and communities from the project. More than one-third of work on the project has been completed by Indigenous people and Coastal GasLink has earmarked $620 million in contracting opportunities for First Nations in the province, it says.
The letter also accuses both the provincial commission and the UN committee of issuing public statements without talking to supportive First Nations.
“Both groups know nothing about the importance we place on finding a way out of endlessly trying to manage poverty, and finding the kind of opportunities for our First Nations people that non-Indigenous people have enjoyed for centuries,” the letter says.
The UN committee also called the federal government to stop two other major resource projects, the Site C dam and Trans Mountain pipeline expansions.
Na’moks, a spokesman for the Wet’suwet’en hereditary clan chiefs, has said they will never consent to the project.
The chiefs issued an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink after the B.C. Supreme Court extended an injunction on Dec. 31 to the company.
The RCMP has established a checkpoint along a logging road that leads to a pipeline work site, as well as two camps and a small settlement established by supporters of the hereditary chiefs
Last year, 14 people were arrested when the RCMP enforced a previous injunction granted to the company.

Disrespectful That Horgan Won't Meet During Northern B.C. Tour: Hereditary Chief | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — It’s disrespectful that Premier John Horgan won’t meet with five hereditary chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline while he is touring northern British Columbia, says the highest-ranking chief.
Chief Na’moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale, said the chiefs have asked the premier for a face-to-face discussion about the Coastal GasLink project.
Na’moks said he was frustrated Horgan didn't meet with the chiefs on Friday, when the premier was in the area touring the LNG Canada project site in Kitimat and meeting with business leaders in Terrace.
“It really bothered me that he was not that far away and yet somehow could not take the time to come and speak with us,” Na’moks said Saturday.
The premier’s office said in a statement that upon receiving the meeting request on Thursday, it reached out to the hereditary chiefs to schedule a phone call.
“The aim of any discussion would be continued dialogue with a focus on de-escalation and on safety for all,” it said.
The office added that the premier has commitments that rule out a meeting on this trip, but he is not ruling out a meeting completely
“Staff continue to be in touch to work on this,” it said.
Na’moks said only an in-person conversation will demonstrate respect for the chiefs, who assert jurisdiction over 22,000 square kilometres of unceded Wet'suwet'en territory.
“We want to show the respect back, too,” he said. “If you’re going to have decent communication with anybody, it's best to be looking eye to eye.”
The chiefs have refused meetings with Coastal GasLink and instead called for discussions with provincial and federal government leaders, arguing the duty to consult is held by the Crown, not the project proponent.
Coastal GasLink has signed benefits agreements with all 20 elected band councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline route. But the hereditary chiefs argue band councils only have jurisdiction over reserve lands rather than unceded territories.
Crystal Smith, elected chief of the Haisla Nation, has said her band council signed an agreement because the project is creating jobs for Indigenous people and lifting communities from poverty.
Horgan said this week that the provincially permitted project will be built, and the rule of law must prevail.
The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against supporters of the hereditary chiefs who are have set up camps close to a pipeline work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order.
However the RCMP has said it's not enforcing the injunction to allow time for dialogue between the hereditary chiefs and Coastal GasLink.
Horgan was set to continue his northern B.C. tour on Saturday with an announcement about a new hospital in Fort St. James and by attending the men's B.C. Winter Classic hockey game in the community.
Meanwhile, Adam Olsen, interim leader of B.C.’s Green party, was set to visit the camps set up by pipeline opponents on Saturday.
Federal Green MP Paul Manly also said he was traveling to Wet’suwe’en territory to meet with the hereditary chiefs.
“I am going to listen and to observe the situation on the ground,” he said in a statement.
“I have publicly stated my support for the hereditary chiefs and others who are engaged in non-violent action to protect Wet’suwet’en land. They are in a very challenging and volatile situation. They need to be heard.”

Pipeline Closure Risks Taking Nearly All Libya’s Oil Offline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Two major oilfields in southwest Libya began shutting down on Sunday after forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar closed a pipeline, potentially reducing national output to a fraction of its normal level, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said.
The closure, which follows a blockade of major eastern oil ports, risked taking almost all the country’s oil output offline as international leaders met in Berlin for a peace summit on Libya.
If exports continue to be blocked, storage tanks will fill in a few days and production will be limited to 72,000 bbls/d from offshore fields and the western Wafa field, an NOC spokesperson said.
Libya has been producing around 1.2 million bbls/d of oil in recent months, and almost all fields lie in areas controlled by Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
The NOC said guards under LNA command had shut down the pipeline leading to the western coastal city of Zawiya on Sunday, forcing the corporation to limit oil production at the Sharara and El Feel oil fields.
El Sharara, operated by the NOC in a joint venture with Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total SA, Austria’s OMV and Norway’s Equinor, has production of around 300,000 bbls/d. El Feel, operated by the NOC and Italy’s Eni, produces about 70,000 bbls/d.
Haftar's LNA has been waging an offensive since April to capture the capital, Tripoli. It is one of two main factions that international powers wanted to agree to a ceasefire in Berlin.
Ahead of the summit, oil ports and oilfields in Libya’s east were shut down, closures that the NOC said were directly ordered by the LNA and would lead to the loss of 800,000 bbls/d.
The move was seen as a pressure tactic ahead of the summit, though the LNA has sought to portray it as the result of popular pressure.
A southern Libyan group, Fezzan Anger, had earlier said it was preparing to shut down the El Sharara and El Feel fields to press their economic and security demands.
Eastern groups aligned with the LNA have long tried to gain control over oil exports and revenues, which are channelled through the central bank and the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.
The Tripoli-based NOC, which says it is neutral and deals with all parties in Libya’s conflict, has warned that any shutdowns could have a lasting impact.
“The oil and gas sector is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy and the single source of income for the Libyan people,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said on Friday. “They are not cards to be played to solve political matters.”
Foreign powers agreed in Berlin to strengthen an arms embargo on Libya and shore up a shaky ceasefire, but the meeting was overshadowed by the blockades.

Secure Seeking Access To Westspur Pipeline At Alida Terminal | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Secure Energy Services Inc., which recently shut down its crude oil terminal in Alida, Sask., has applied to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) for orders to allow it to receive crude oil from, and deliver crude oil to, the Westspur pipeline owned by Kingston Midstream Westspur Limited.
 “As the Westspur pipeline is an oil pipeline, Kingston is obligated under the [Canadian Energy Regulator] Act to accept, ship and deliver all oil tendered to it, unless it can demonstrate that complying with its common carrier obligation is unreasonable,” says Secure in its application. It notes that there is capacity on the pipeline and argues that Kingston has not provided any reasonable basis for its refusal to provide the access requested by Secure, especially as there are existing facilities to facilitate the access.
Secure, which acquired the Alida terminal in June 2016, says it requires both delivery and receipt access to the Westspur pipeline to optimize the operation of the terminal and maintain its economic feasibility while providing customers with a competitive option to access markets in Eastern Canada and the PADD II and PADD III regions in the United States. 
The Westspur pipeline, which is regulated by the commission, transports crude oil and condensate from southeast Saskatchewan via the Weyburn pipeline and the Saskatchewan Pipeline Gathering System to the Enbridge Inc. Mainline receipt point at Cromer in Manitoba. The Saskatchewan System along with the Westspur and Weyburn pipelines function as an operationally integrated crude oil transportation system and account for the majority of crude oil pipeline transportation in the region, Secure notes. Apart from the Enbridge Mainline, each of the pipeline systems is operated by an affiliate of Kingston.
Until recently, Secure received trucked-in volumes of crude oil, heavy oil and diluents at its terminal and provided custom crude oil and petroleum blending and optimization services. Through an interconnection agreement with Kingston's predecessor, Enbridge Pipelines (Saskatchewan) Inc., Secure received volumes from the Westspur Pipeline via a six-inch pipeline from Kingston’s Alida terminal (reversal line) and delivered a pipeline specification product to Kingston via a six-inch pipeline (delivery line) for delivery onto the Westspur pipeline and transportation to the Enbridge Mainline. 
Under the agreement, Secure paid tolls on the Saskatchewan System to move volumes from its Alida terminal to Kingston’s terminal and, where applicable, paid an additional toll on the Westspur pipeline. Secure said that despite having to pay the Saskatchewan System toll, due to its blending and optimization activities it was able to provide a competitive alternative to the Kingston Alida terminal, often resulting in higher netbacks to producers.
Interconnection termination 
However, on March 27, 2019, Kingston provided 60 days' notice to Secure that it was terminating the interconnection agreement, effective May 26, 2019.
Kingston later informed Secure that it could continue to nominate trucked-in crude volumes to the Saskatchewan System, subject to meeting the Saskatchewan System rules and regulations (R and R) and paying the system toll. However, Kingston noted that, as a carrier under the R and R, it is not obligated to accept crude oil that has been subject to ""blending activities"" other than those conducted by the carrier, an affiliate of the carrier or an  ""authorized blending facility,” says Secure whose Alida terminal is not considered an “authorized blending facility.”
 “The combined effect of the termination of the Former Interconnection Agreement, Kingston’s insistence that Secure was connected to the Saskatchewan System, and the operation of the Saskatchewan System R and R, was to remove all access by Secure to crude volumes from the Westspur pipeline via the reversal line, and effectively prohibit Secure from delivering blended oil from the Secure Alida terminal to Kingston,” says Secure.
Secure continued to operate for a time by not passing the Saskatchewan System toll on to its customers but with no blending upsides to offset the tolls, after making every effort to renegotiate a new arrangement with Kingston, and after suffering significant financial losses, the company says it was eventually forced to pass through the toll to its customers.  Within a matter of days, all of Secure's customers ceased deliveries to its Alida terminal. Secure says it understands that all or most of those volumes are now delivered to Kingston’s Alida terminal which is not subject to the Saskatchewan System toll.
As a result, Secure was forced to lay off staff and mothball its Alida terminal with estimated annual lost revenues of approximately $2.8 million to $5.1 million per year.
Kingston’s termination also has negatively affected Secure’s customers whose agreements were wound up, says Secure. The Alida terminal provided an alternative to Kingston’s Alida terminal which allowed for price competition and likely reduced congestion of truck offloading, especially during times of increased traffic (such as breakup), it says. “Kingston's actions result in reduced competition for producer volumes in Saskatchewan (and thereby higher costs and lower netbacks).”
Secure also notes that part of Kingston's business includes crude oil marketing, blending and trading activities and in this regard it is in direct competition with certain parties, including Secure, that require access to the Westspur pipeline. “Given its virtual monopoly on crude oil pipeline transportation, by denying Secure access to the pipeline, Kingston is able to obtain an unfair business advantage and is able to realize the economic upside on blending activities, while denying such upside to Secure and its customers,” says Secure.
Connection to Westspur pipeline
In its application, Secure says Kingston contends that the Secure Alida terminal ties into the Saskatchewan System and therefore does not connect to the Westspur pipeline system. “While the Former Interconnection Agreement treated the Secure Alida Terminal as if it were connected to the Saskatchewan System, this was done for commercial purposes,” says Secure. “In reality, Secure submits that it is clear the Secure Alida terminal is physically tied into the Westspur pipeline system.”
 Secure’s Alida terminal is connected to Kingston’s Alida terminal by two, six-inch steel underground pipelines, according to Secure. The Kingston Alida terminal, it says, is a receipt point on the Westspur pipeline and is approximately 350 metres from the Secure Alida terminal.
“It is clear in Secure's view that the Kingston Alida terminal forms part of the Westspur pipeline system and is subject to regulation by the commission,” says Secure. “As there can be no question that the Secure Alida terminal is connected to the Kingston Alida terminal, it is therefore also connected to the Westspur pipeline system.”
If the Secure Alida terminal is tied into the Saskatchewan System — which Secure disputes — the connections would nonetheless be proximate to the Westspur pipeline with only minor pipeline relocation work anticipated to connect to the pipeline, says the company. A preliminary high-level estimate of the costs of any interconnection work, if required, is $400,000 says Secure which says it is prepared to pay all costs that the CER considers to be fair and reasonable to interconnect its terminal to the Westspur pipeline.
The Westspur pipeline is owned by Kingston Midstream Westspur Limited (formerly TEML Westspur Pipelines Limited), which in turn is owned by Kingston Midstream Limited. TEML Westspur Pipelines was formerly owned by Tundra Energy Marketing Limited (TEML) which is now Kingston Marketing Limited, also owned by Kingston Midstream Limited.

Miscommunication Led To Three People Turned Away At Pipeline Checkpoint: RCMP | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– The RCMP says miscommunication led to three people being turned away at a checkpoint outside a natural gas pipeline work site in northern British Columbia, a situation that has sparked a complaint by a civil liberties association.
Supporters of Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who oppose the Coastal GasLink project have set up three camps and settlements between the checkpoint and the work site.
The Mounties said in a news release Wednesday that there was some miscommunication as frontline police were implementing new access procedures after the checkpoint was set up on Monday morning.
Of the three people who were turned away, the RCMP said one would not provide basic details, such as identification and purpose of travel, another faced a shift in weather conditions as nightfall approached and the third person was refused access to transport food and supplies.
The police officer at the checkpoint made arrangements for the supplies to be transported in by a different person, but both individuals decided not to proceed and left the area, Mounties said.
The RCMP said since the procedures have been clarified it has not received any reports of further issues and most individuals have been able to proceed.
“The access control checkpoint is a measured response that reflects the need to prevent further escalation of the situation including the placement of hazards along the roadway and the creation of a third encampment blocking access,” it said.
“It also allows the RCMP to be accountable for the safety of all persons accessing this area given the hazards, unplowed roads and severe winter conditions.”
The B.C. Civil Liberties Association announced Wednesday it has filed complaints to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP on behalf of two individuals who it said were bringing food and emergency supplies but were denied access.
The commission is an independent agency responsible for examining complaints of improper on-duty conduct by RCMP members.
Harsha Walia, executive director of the civil liberties association, said at a news conference she is concerned about the use of exclusion zones prohibiting Wet'suwet'en people, the public and media from accessing the First Nation's territories.
The association's two clients are a Wet'suwet'en woman and a Haida man who is married to a Wet'suwet'en woman and has been adopted into the nation, she said.
By preventing them access to the First Nation's traditional territory, RCMP violated their Indigenous rights and charter-protected rights, she said.
“We are deeply concerned by what's happening in Wet’suwet’en territories,” she said. “The RCMP is claiming broad and vague powers of public safety despite no stated or identifiable threat.”
However, the RCMP said the checkpoint is not an exclusion zone, which are areas created when police enforce a civil injunction. It said it's not enforcing a B.C. Supreme Court injunction to allow time for dialogue between the hereditary chiefs and Coastal GasLink.
The B.C. Supreme Court granted Coastal GasLink the injunction Dec. 31 and the order authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone they have reasonable or probable grounds to believe is knowingly contravening the order.
The RCMP said its operations commander had conducted a review of officers’ actions at the checkpoint and concluded police appeared to be acting professionally and in good faith.
“If there are public complaints made, we will ensure full disclosure of all information regarding the interaction including the video captured by police,” it said.
Representatives from the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, a University of British Columbia law professor and the treasurer of the B.C. Government Employees’ Union joined the civil liberties association at the news conference.
While Premier John Horgan said this week that the permitted project will go through and the rule of the law must be respected, law professor Margot Young said it's not that simple.
There are other rights and laws, including Indigenous rights outlined in the constitution, local Wet’suwet’en laws, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people that should be considered, Young said
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip said it’s time to stop relying on “low level” injunctions and RCMP enforcement, and make room for broader consideration of Indigenous rights.
“There needs to be time and space set aside for a very thorough adjudication of the common law, the Wet’suwet’en law and all aspects and dimensions of this very complicated issue,” he said.

Supreme Court Dismisses B.C.’s Appeal In Trans Mountain Pipeline Case | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) – Supreme Court of Canada shut down British Columbia’s move to regulate what can flow through an expanded Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta.
B.C. was appealing to the country's highest court after the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled last May that the province couldn't impose any restrictions on the contents on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court agreed.
“We are all of the view to dismiss the appeal for the unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,” Chief Justice Richard Wagner said.
The decision was issued from the bench after several hours of hearings today in Ottawa.
It removes one of the remaining obstacles for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which seeks to twin an existing pipeline running between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C.
The B.C. NDP government was elected in 2017 partly on a promise to oppose the expansion but the province had limited options because the Constitution gives the federal government jurisdiction over transportation projects that cross provincial borders.
That includes pipelines.
Still, B.C. argued it has jurisdiction to protect the environment in its borders and since that province would bear the brunt of any damage from a spill if the pipeline ruptured, it should get a say in what can flow through it.
In April 2018, it filed a reference case with the B.C. Court of Appeal asking it to rule on whether the province could change its environment laws so that it could require permits for any heavy oil that was to flow through new pipelines.
The B.C. Court of Appeal ruled in May 2019 that it could not, noting that would overstep the constitutional authority given to Ottawa. The court also noted while B.C. was trying to portray the legislation as a general change to its environment laws, it was clearly targeting the Trans Mountain expansion, since that was the only project to which the changes would apply.
The case was the catalyst that led to the federal government's decision to buy the existing pipeline in May 2018 for $4.5 billion. Kinder Morgan Canada Limited said the political risk that the project would never get built was too much to bear and was planning to halt the expansion.
The federal Liberals argue the pipeline is needed to get more Canadian oil to foreign markets beyond the United States and bought the existing pipeline with a view to completing the expansion once the legal and political challenges were out of the way.
It intends to sell it back to the private sector after the expansion is complete.
Although construction on the pipeline is underway, there remain other barriers to its completion, including a legal challenge by Indigenous communities affected by the construction. They argue they were not properly consulted before Ottawa gave the project a green light.

Pipeline At Centre Of B.C. Conflict Is Creating Jobs For First Nations: Chief | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– A pipeline at the centre of a conflict between hereditary chiefs and a natural gas company in northern British Columbia is creating jobs for Indigenous people and lifting communities from poverty, says an elected chief of a band that supports the project.
All 20 elected band councils along the Coastal GasLink pipeline route have signed benefits agreements with the company. The Haisla Nation in Kitimat is among them and Chief Coun. Crystal Smith said the project will help the community become less reliant on meagre federal funding.
“Our governance system has been managing poverty. It’s a similar situation in every First Nation in this province, in this country, of managing limited funds to be able to assist our people,” Smith said.
“In order to achieve independent nations, we need independent members. The opportunities that are available for today's generation and future generations of First Nations people that participate in these projects are life changing. They're nation changing.”
The 670-kilometre pipeline will deliver natural gas from the Dawson Creek area to a liquefaction facility in Kitimat as part of the $40-billion LNG Canada project
However, five Wet’suwet’en hereditary clan chiefs say the pipeline cannot proceed without their consent. Their supporters at a camp near Smithers have been blocking construction in violation of a court injunction.
The elected band council of the Wet’suwet’en, on the other hand, has signed a benefits deal to support the pipeline.
The dispute has highlighted a debate over whether hereditary chiefs should have more power under Canadian law. The Indian Act established band councils, made up of elected chiefs and councillors, who have authority over reserve lands. Hereditary chiefs are part of a traditional form of Indigenous governance that courts have grappled with how to recognize.
Wet’suwet’en hereditary chief Na’moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale, said he wishes pipeline supporters would consider the dangers of the project.
“These man camps are dangerous places. They fly in and fly out, they have no social responsibility to where they are. They get to go home. We are home,” he said.
Smith said many of those employed on the pipeline are Indigenous or B.C. residents.
The Haisla Nation is also in discussions for equity stakes in the project, which would create revenue that the community could decide to invest in housing, health or education, in contrast with federal money that comes with restrictions on how it can be used, she said.
Smith said her band council signed benefits agreements with both Coastal GasLink and LNG Canada. The details of the deals are confidential but Smith said they contain clauses that ensure environmental protection and remediation of the First Nation's territories.
“Our territories aren’t new to development or industry: forestry, aluminum smelters. Back when those developments were occurring, our nation wasn’t a part of the development. We had no say. We had no share,” she said.
“Within these projects, we have a seat at the table in terms of how they’re developed, how they’re built and the impacts on our community and our territory.”
Smith said it’s concerning that the pipeline blockade is impeding the progress of the project and she believes chiefs, whether hereditary or elected, should put the interests of their people first in decision making.
She added that she “feels” for the Wet’suwet’en community.
“Issues like this divide communities. They tear families apart. They ruin lifelong friendships,” she said.
Na’moks questioned how Smith could feel for the Wet’suwet’en when she is not a member herself.
“We look after our nation,” he said.
Mike Robertson, a policy adviser with the Cheslatta Carrier Nation, said the pipeline is located north of his community so it has not signed a benefits agreement, but it has a more minimal deal known as a community agreement.
Robertson said his community is wary of some of the negative impacts of a work camp setting up in the area. But he said it has equipment and will do right-of-way clearing and other work as the project progresses, and it hopes to play a bigger role in construction.
“We definitely support the project,” he said. “This economic development coming through our community is positive.”

TC Energy To Resume Work On Keystone XL Oil Pipeline In February | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — TC Energy Corporation said on Tuesday it planned to start pre-construction work in February for its Keystone XL oil pipeline, the start of what it expects to be a busy work schedule for the long-delayed project.
TC said in a filing with U.S. District Court in Montana that in February it would start mobilizing heavy construction equipment in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, and aim to begin building a 1.93 kilometre-segment spanning the U.S.-Canada border in April.
Work on the border-crossing segment is subject to receiving federal approvals, including a right-of-way and temporary use permit, TC said.
The $8 billion Keystone XL project would carry 830,000 bbls/d of oil sands crude from Alberta to the U.S. Midwest and then on to the Gulf Coast. It has been delayed for more than a decade by opposition from landowners, environmental groups and tribes, and after former U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the project.
The State Department has yet to issue a final environmental impact statement. A judge ruled in November 2018 the agency had not conducted an adequate review of the pipeline.
U.S. President Donald Trump in March last year signed a new permission for the pipeline, a move in his administration’s pursuit of “energy dominance,” or maximizing production of oil, gas and coal for domestic use and exports.
Congested pipelines have resulted in lower Canadian prices and government-ordered production curtailments in the province of Alberta.
“Keystone XL is crucial in building market access for Alberta, ensuring high-quality Canadian oil that can be relied upon throughout North America,” Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage said in a statement, adding that she is pleased with TC’s construction schedule.
TC said it plans to start building pumping stations along the pipeline route in June. Work on a pipeline segment in Nebraska would also start in June, followed by the start of construction of segments in Montana and South Dakota in August.
The schedule hinges on starting to mobilize equipment in February, TC said. Work will continue in 2021.

Supreme Court To Hear B.C. Case Attempting To Halt Trans Mountain Expansion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — Canada’s high court will hear arguments Thursday on whether British Columbia can stop Alberta from shipping heavy oil through the Trans Mountain pipeline without a permit.
B.C.’s NDP government brought the case in 2018 as it worked to fulfil an election promise to stop the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.
The province argues it should be able to limit the contents of the pipeline, because it would bear the brunt of environmental harm from any spill.
The federal government will argue that B.C.’s move would give the province a veto over interprovincial projects it doesn't like, counter to the constitutional authority Ottawa has over any transportation project that crosses provincial boundaries.
B.C.’s decision to file the challenge was the final straw for Kinder Morgan Canada Limited and its investors, who then decided to pull the plug on the expansion project — prompting Ottawa to buy the pipeline for $4.5 billion.

"Horgan Says ‘Rule Of Law Applies,’ Coastal GasLink Will Proceed Despite Protests | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(The Canadian Press) — A natural gas pipeline across northern British Columbia is vital to the region’s economic future and it will be built despite the objections of some Indigenous leaders, Premier John Horgan said Monday.
He said the courts have ruled in favour of the project and the rule of law will apply to ensure work continues on the Coastal GasLink pipeline, which would start near Dawson Creek and extend to an export terminal at Kitimat.
The 670-kilometre pipeline is part of a $40 billion LNG Canada project.
Horgan told a news conference the project has received approval from 20 First Nations along the pipeline route.
“We want everyone to understand that there are agreements from the Peace Country to Kitimat with Indigenous communities that want to see economic activity and prosperity take place,” he said. “All the permits are in place for this project to proceed. This project is proceeding and the rule of law needs to prevail in B.C.”
Hereditary chiefs from the Wet’suwet’en Nation near Smithers say the project does not have their consent. Supporters of the chiefs have felled trees along a road to a Coastal GasLink work site and are building a new support camp.
They already occupy two other camps along the road. The Unist’ot’en camp and the Gidimt’en camp, where the RCMP enforced an injunction last year and arrested 14 people.
A B.C. Supreme Court judge extended an injunction against Wet’suwet’en members and anti-pipeline supporters on Dec. 31.
Coastal GasLink posted the injunction order last week giving opponents 72 hours to clear the way to its work site. The company said it was up to police to determine the “timing and manner of enforcement of this order.”
The RCMP began restricting access on Monday to the area where the court injunction applies.
The Mounties say a police checkpoint was set up at the 27-kilometre mark of a forestry road into the area because of safety concerns stemming from the trees that were felled across the road and tire piles that were recently found with gasoline and other fuels inside.
Those entering the area on the road are being stopped by police and given a copy of the court's injunction, as well as being informed about hazards and road conditions.
The RCMP said those being allowed to enter must have permission from the RCMP's operations commander, which generally includes hereditary and elected chiefs, elected and other government officials, accredited journalists from recognized media outlets, and those providing food, medicine or other supplies.
The RCMP said its commanding officer in British Columbia has been involved in a series of meetings and more are planned with the hereditary chiefs, elected band councils and others with an interest in the pipeline.
“It was emphasized that the primary concerns for the RCMP are public and officer safety,” it says in a statement released on Monday. “Our duty is to preserve the safety of everyone involved in this dispute, and to prevent further contraventions to the B.C. Supreme Court ordered injunction.'”
The Wet’suwet’en hereditary clan chiefs have asked the RCMP not to use force against the pipeline opponents who are facing the injunction order.
Horgan said Indigenous Peoples in B.C. have used the courts to successfully assert their rights and title, but in ``this instance the courts have confirmed that the project can proceed and will proceed.''
Horgan’s government adopted legislation late last year to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It mandates the government to bring provincial laws and policies into harmony with the declaration's aims of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.
The UN declaration says Indigenous Peoples have the right to self-determination, which means they can determine their political status and pursue economic, social and cultural development. It requires governments to obtain “free and informed consent” from Indigenous groups before approving projects affecting their lands or resources.
But Horgan says the declaration doesn’t apply to the Coastal GasLink project.
“Our document, our legislation, our declaration is forward looking,” he said. “It’s not retrospective. We believe it will open up opportunities not just for Indigenous people but for all British Columbians.”

CER Asked To Suspend Regulatory Process In Keystone Tariff Complaint | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd. has proposed that the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) suspend the regulatory process into complaints about its proposed new tariff and allow Keystone and its term shippers to enter into settlement discussions in Canada. 
“It is reasonable for term shippers and Keystone to enter into commercial discussions prior to employing the CER’s formal regulatory process,” Keystone said in a filing today, noting that similar settlement discussions are underway with parties in the United States.
 The company said it has contacted all term shippers so that relevant parties may enter into settlement discussions to effectively mirror the settlement process that is currently underway at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to Keystone’s U.S. tariff. “The goal of such discussions would be to sufficiently address such issues prior to determining 2020 final variable tolls and respective true-up mechanism,” said Keystone.
In its letter to the CER, Keystone also asked for an expedited decision.
Phillips 66 Canada Ltd. earlier filed a complaint with the CER about the revised Canadian tariff that includes a 22.5 per cent increase in variable tolls. It asked the commission to establish a public proceeding to examine whether the proposed rates, or tolls, proposed are just and reasonable. The CER has determined the revised tolls should be interim as of Jan. 1, 2020.
Husky Oil Operations Limited and Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC in letters to the CER supported Phillips 66 Canada.
In the U.S., Husky US Marketing LLC, Phillips 66 Company and Suncor Energy Marketing Inc.  filed a joint  protest with the FERC regarding Keystone’s  U.S. toll filing. Coffeyville later filed a protest with the FERC.
 On Dec. 30, 2019, the FERC accepted Keystone’s U.S. toll filing as-filed (subject to refund) and established a process to hold any further hearing process in abeyance in order to provide time for settlement conference procedures.

B.C. First Nation Gives Coastal GasLink One Time Access To Winterize Site | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — A spokeswoman for the Unist’ot’en Healing Center says the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs have given a natural gas company one-time access to a construction site so it can be winterized.
Karla Tait says Coastal GasLink has six to eight hours for a work crew to winterize their personnel accommodations and equipment at Site 9A to avoid damages to the company's assets and the surrounding environment.
Wet’suwet’en First Nation issued an eviction notice on Jan. 5 to Coastal GasLink for an area within their traditional territory near Houston, B.C.
Tait says the access will be monitored by a Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chief, a third party contractor and a media recorder to ensure it is in compliance with the access terms.
Coastal GasLink spokeswoman Suzanne Wilton says crews are on site and maintenance work is anticipated to take several hours.
The company has provincial approval to build a 670-kilometre pipeline from northeastern British Columbia to LNG Canada’s $40-billion export terminal in Kitimat, but the chiefs say they won’t allow anyone on the First Nation’s traditional territory without their consent.

Maintenance Completed At Coastal GasLink Work Camp | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Coastal GasLink on Sunday worked co-operatively with the Unist’ot’en (Dark House) and completed maintenance work on its construction worksite in northeast British Columbia to prevent damage when it remains unoccupied, a company spokesperson said today.
“We appreciated the agreement of the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs for access and are committed to continuing our effort to meet and find common ground,” Suzanne Wilton said in an email.  “Our focus remains on finding a peaceful and mutually agreeable resolution.”
The hereditary chiefs had allowed the company one-time access to the site to winterize their personal accommodations following service of an eviction notice Jan. 5. 2020 for the area within Wet’suwet’en First Nation traditional territory near Houston. Although the pipeline has the support of all elected First Nations councils along the route, the chiefs have opposed the project.
A B.C. Supreme Court judge earlier ruled Coastal GasLink has the permits and authorizations for the project and had satisfied the requirements for an interlocutory injunction which would allow work to proceed on the pipeline from the Montney producing area to the LNG  Canada project at Kitimat.

Increased Throughput Planned For Express Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Express Pipeline Ltd. is seeking regulatory approval on behalf of Express Pipeline Limited Partnership for a facility expansion to increase annual average throughput on the Express L40A system by about eight per cent.
The increase in the throughput rate to approximately 310,000 bbls/d from about 287,000 bbls/d will be achieved by the installation of one pre-fabricated drag reducing agent (DRA) skid at the Express Hardisty terminal, says Express in an application to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). The estimated cost is $855,000.
The skid will be added to existing leak detection and facilities integrity models for the terminal and the increased throughput on Line 40A would be monitored as part of the line’s existing integrity program, said Express.
The targeted in-serviced date is July 10, 2020.

Coastal GasLink Posts 72-Hour Notice To Clear Way In Northern B.C. | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — Coastal GasLink has posted an injunction order giving opponents 72 hours to clear the way toward its work site in northern British Columbia, although the company says its focus remains finding a peaceful resolution that avoids enforcement.
The order stamped Tuesday by the B.C. Supreme Court registry addresses members of the Wet’suwet’en Nation and supporters who say the Coastal GasLink project has no authority without consent from the five hereditary clan chiefs.
It comes one year after the RCMP’s enforcement of a similar injunction along the same road.
The order requires the defendants to remove any obstructions including cabins and gates on any roads, bridges or work sites the company has been authorized to use.
If they don’t remove the obstructions themselves, the court says the company is at liberty to remove them.
It gives authorization to the RCMP to arrest and remove anyone police have “reasonable or probable grounds” to believe has knowledge of the order and is contravening it.
“The police retain discretion as to timing and manner of enforcement of this order,” it says.
Coastal GasLink, however, says posting the order was procedural and the company has no plans to request police action.
The B.C. Supreme Court granted an injunction to Coastal GasLink on Dec. 31. The order stamped Tuesday provides details of the court injunction.
Previous injunction and enforcement orders remained in effect until the new order was issued, Coastal GasLink spokeswoman Suzanne Wilton said.
Obstructing access was already prohibited under the previous orders and they also included enforcement provisions.
“We continue to believe that dialogue is preferable to confrontation while engagement and a negotiated resolution remain possible,” Wilton said in an email.
The company declined an interview request.
The order does not apply to a metal gate on the west side of a bridge outside the Unist’ot’en camp, unless it is used to prevent or impede the workers' access.
Hereditary chiefs negotiated last year with the RCMP for the gate to remain outside the camp, which is home to some members of one of the First Nation's 13 house groups, so long as it would not be used to prevent workers from accessing the work site.
Fourteen people were arrested by police officers at a checkpoint constructed along the road leading to both the Unist’ot’en camp and the Coastal GasLink work site on Jan. 7, 2019.
The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline route, but the five Wet’suwet’en hereditary clan chiefs say no one can access the land without their consent.
The pipeline is part of the $40-billion LNG Canada project that will export Canadian natural gas to Asian markets.
Coastal GasLink shared photos Tuesday of what it says are more than 100 trees that have been felled across the logging road.
The RCMP said its officers came across the fallen trees on Monday as they were conducting regular safety patrols along the Morice West Forest Service Road. In a statement, the RCMP said some trees along the road are a safety hazard because they were partly cut and the wind could cause them to fall without warning.
Police say they also found three stacks of tires covered by tarps and trees, which contained several jugs of gasoline, diesel, oil, kindling and bags of fuel-soaked rags.
The RCMP say the hereditary chiefs were advised of what was found and have been told police are conducting a criminal investigation over traps that are likely to cause bodily harm.
“We want to emphasize that we are impartial in this dispute and our priority is to facilitate a dialogue between the various stakeholders involved,” the Mounties said. “We remain hopeful that these efforts will result in a resolution.’
At a news conference Tuesday, hereditary chief Na’moks called for construction to cease and for the B.C. government to revoke the company's permits.
He said the Wet’suwet’en felled the trees to protect their own safety.
Members of the Gidimt’en, one of five Wet’suwet’en clans, and supporters reoccupied the area along the logging road in April near the site where the injunction was enforced last year.
Jen Wickham says her fellow members are concerned that it could be enforced before the 72 hours is up, since a previous injunction was already in place.
Lawyer Michael Lee Ross, who represents the Wet’suwet’en members named in the injunction, said once the new injunction order was stamped, the previous one became a historic document.
However, he said the RCMP could step in at any time if they find reason to.
Ross said his clients are discussing a possible appeal of the order.
“A challenge of an order is normally a challenge of the legal basis on which the order is grounded. So that is one of the avenues that is still open to them,” he said Wednesday.

Kinder Morgan Sells Pembina Shares | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Kinder Morgan, Inc. has sold all of the approximately 25 million shares of Pembina Pipeline Corporation stock it received in connection with Pembina’s acquisition of the outstanding common equity of Kinder Morgan Canada Limited.
The sale of these shares is consistent with KMI’s previously announced intention to convert the shares into cash in an opportunistic and non-disruptive manner, and the after-tax proceeds of $764 million are consistent with KMI’s 2020 budget.
As previously disclosed, KMI intends to use the proceeds to pay down debt, creating balance sheet flexibility in 2020 (relative to KMI’s long-term leverage target of 4.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA).

Hereditary Chiefs Say They Will Protect Territory In Pipeline Dispute | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — On the first anniversary of the RCMP’s enforcement of an injunction against opponents of a natural gas pipeline in northern British Columbia, First Nation hereditary chiefs said the company behind the project is not welcome on their traditional territory.
Chief Na’moks said Tuesday there will be no access to the territory without the consent of the chiefs, who are demanding the province stop construction of the pipeline and that the RCMP withdraw from their land.
“If they wish to force their way on, that is not our choice, that is theirs,” Na’moks told a news conference.
“We are peaceful but we will protect our territory.”
Na’moks said Coastal GasLink is not allowed on the First Nation’s 22,000 square kilometres of traditional territory and its leadership is unwilling to meet with the company.
Coastal GasLink has received approval from the provincial government to build a 670-kilometre pipeline from northeastern B.C. to LNG Canada's $40-billion export terminal in Kitimat. The company signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along the route, but the hereditary chiefs say the project doesn't have authority without their consent as well.
On Dec. 31, the B.C. Supreme Court granted another interim injunction to the company against members of the First Nation and supporters who oppose the pipeline.
In an interview, Na’moks said relations haven’t improved since 14 people were arrested by police and a checkpoint built on the road leading to a work site was dismantled on Jan. 7, 2019.
The hereditary chiefs issued an eviction notice to the company on the weekend. Na’moks said trees were felled across the road leading to the work site for the safety of local residents.
Coastal GasLink declined an interview request but in a statement it said work could be delayed in an area at the centre of the dispute, but it is ready to resume construction. It added that it is willing to “discuss issues of importance” with the chiefs.
The company is resuming work generally across the pipeline right-of-way, but it believes “dialogue is preferable to confrontation” and will delay workers returning to the area while a negotiated resolution remains possible, it said.
Na’moks declined the offer.
“If there are going to be meetings, it will be between the decision-makers,” he said, adding that includes the provincial and federal governments, as well as the federal RCMP commissioner, but not local governments or the company.
As of Tuesday, he said the First Nation had received no response from any level of government, nor from the RCMP’s leadership.
Public Safety Minister Bill Blair’s office said in a statement the federal government is aware of the hereditary chiefs’ request and it is “hopeful that the parties can come together in the near future to discuss how to resolve this issue.”
The Mounties also acknowledged the chiefs’ request for RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki to get involved, but said she supports Deputy Commissioner Jennifer Strachan, who as the force’s commanding officer in B.C. “is well-positioned as our decision-maker in these matters.”
“Deputy Commissioner Strachan, along with her senior management team, have been actively engaged in facilitating a discussion with all the stakeholders,” the RCMP said in a statement. “That remains our utmost priority at this time and are optimistic that a meeting can take place immediately between the various stakeholders involved to find common ground and a peaceful resolution.”
It says police will continue to patrol the Morice River Forest Service Road in the area “to ensure everyone’s safety.”
Na’moks said the province must address the issue of consent before the hereditary chiefs grant any access to the land.
The provincial Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources did not directly address the demands made by the chiefs, but in a statement it noted that the court has affirmed the company is “lawfully permitted to conduct their work.”
“We encourage representatives to engage with the company to achieve a resolution that respects the court’s decision and ensures safety for all,” it said.
On Tuesday, the hereditary chiefs said they were acting in accordance with their laws on behalf of the five clans of the Wet’suwet’en nation.
“The province has proclaimed they will implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which includes free, prior and informed consent, but has failed to intervene in this issue,” the chiefs said in a statement.

Coastal GasLink Hopeful Of Negotiated Resolution In Pipeline Dispute | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Coastal GasLink  says it will delay remobilization near a disputed site in northeast British Columbia while it engages with hereditary chiefs in an attempt to achieve a negotiated resolution over their opposition to the project.
The company in a statement today said it has written to Chief Namox to set up a meeting to discuss issues of importance to the hereditary chiefs of the Office of the Wet’suwet’en. “Based on Chief Namox public comments, we anticipate a positive response to our meeting request and hope that a meeting can be set up quickly to resolve the issues at hand,” it said.
While Coastal GasLink is restarting work generally across the right-of-way, “we believe that dialogue is preferable to confrontation and will delay re-mobilization near workforce accommodation site 9A while engagement and a negotiated resolution remain possible,” it said.
The Unist’ot’en have been informed that the company will periodically need to visit sites in and around site 9A for safety and environmental reasons while the accommodation site remains unoccupied, said the company.
Last weekend, the hereditary chiefs served an eviction notice on Coastal GasLink,  ordering its staff and contractors to immediately leave the unceded territory.
A B.C. Supreme Court judge earlier ruled Coastal GasLink had has the permits and authorizations for the project and had satisfied the requirements for an interlocutory injunction which would allow work to proceed on the pipeline from the Montney producing area to the LNG  Canada project at Kitimat.

B.C. Pipeline Project To Resume Work Despite Opposition | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — The company building a natural gas pipeline as part of a $40-billion LNG project in northern British Columbia says it plans to resume construction despite an eviction notice served by members of a First Nation over the weekend.
Coastal GasLink said in a statement Monday it will hold safety refresher meetings for construction crews on Tuesday and Wednesday, but clearing and other work activities are expected to continue this week, including delivery of pipeline materials.
Most construction activities on the 670-kilometre pipeline, other than security and maintenance, were suspended starting Dec. 20 until Sunday because of the holidays, the company said.
The $6.2-billion pipeline would transport natural gas from the Dawson Creek area to LNG Canada’s export terminal in Kitimat on the coast.
The company statement on its website comes after Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs issued a letter Saturday advising the company that its staff and contractors were “trespassing” on unceded territory and demanded they leave immediately.
Fourteen protesters were arrested last January when the RCMP enforced an interim injunction at a pipeline blockade near Smithers.
The hereditary chiefs were meeting Monday and could not be immediately reached for comment, but a news conference was scheduled for Tuesday in Smithers to mark the one-year anniversary of arrests at the Wet’suwet’en camp known as Gidimt’en.
The Gidimt’en camp is one of two long-standing Wet’suwet’en locations occupied by people opposed to the pipeline. The Unist’ot’en camp, also along the pipeline route, was first set up a decade ago.
In a statement, the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs said Tuesday’s news conference will address “the eviction, and the possibilities of what comes next, as well as what is required for respectful nation-to-nation engagement.”
Protests and fundraising events to support opposition to the pipeline are planned for Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria and Rochester in the coming days.
Coastal GasLink said while its workers complied with the eviction notice the company is legally permitted to operate in the area and the only people on the site over the weekend were security staff.
On Dec. 31, the B.C. Supreme Court granted the company an injunction against anyone blocking forest roads to the site.
Coastal GasLink said it was notified on Friday by the Unist’ot’en that the group intends to terminate an agreement that had granted the company access.
The company said it has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along the pipeline path, but five hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en say the project has no authority without their consent.

B.C. First Nation Serves Eviction Notice To Coastal GasLink | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — A First Nation in British Columbia has served a company that wants to build a natural gas pipeline through its territory an eviction notice.
“This notice is to inform you that all Coastal GasLink staff and contractors currently trespassing on unceded Wet’suwet’en territory must vacate our territory immediately,” reads a letter from the First Nation's hereditary chiefs to the company whose $6.6-billion pipeline would transport natural gas across 670 kilometres from northeastern B.C. to the LNG Canada export terminal in Kitimat.
Coastal GasLink workers and contractors in the area near Houston, B.C., complied with the notice peacefully Saturday night, confirmed two spokespeople for Indigenous groups.
A spokeswoman for Coastal GasLink, Suzanne Wilton, said in an emailed statement that “the only people on site Saturday were security staff.” The company expects construction to resume this week after a holiday break, she wrote.
At first, the workers were reluctant, said Na’Moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale and is the highest-ranking hereditary chief of Tsayu, one of the five clans that make up the First Nation.
He estimates it took workers between 90 minutes and two hours to leave.
Coastal GasLink, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment beyond the emailed statement, said on its website that it received the notice.
It “demanded that we remove our equipment from areas in which we are legally permitted to operate,” the company said.
Coastal GasLink also said it was notified on Jan. 3 by Unist’ot’en that the Indigenous group intends to terminate an access agreement effective Jan. 10.
The company’s workers also discovered felled trees early Sunday morning that make a road impassable, it said.
""While it is unclear who felled these trees, this action is a clear violation of the interlocutory injunction as it prevents our crews from accessing work areas,'' it said in the statement.
On Dec. 31, the B.C. Supreme Court granted the company an injunction against members of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation and others who oppose the company's pipeline.
Na’Moks said his group’s position is that the ruling was misinformed.
Coastal GasLink said it was “disappointed” Unist’ot’en decided to terminate the agreement after it was in place for a year and is requesting to meet with the group and hereditary chiefs as soon as possible.

Mexico’s President To Ask For Planned Gas Pipeline To Be Rerouted | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that he will ask for a natural gas pipeline being developed by TC Energy Corporation to be rerouted so it does not cut across lands considered sacred by communities in Puebla state.
“Even if we have to pay, the gas pipeline will not go through the sacred hills,” Lopez Obrador said on Saturday while visiting the town of Pahuatlan in Puebla.
The Tuxpan-Tula pipeline is set to stretch 286 kilometres (178 miles), delivering fuel from Tuxpan in Veracruz state to the states of Puebla and Hidalgo.
Lopez Obrador's government last year persuaded companies to waive significant profits from natural gas pipeline deals signed under the previous administration after renegotiating the contracts to save taxpayers $4.5 billion.
That months-long dispute caused diplomatic frictions with Canada in particular, aggravating concerns that Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who took office in December 2018, could call into question contracts signed before he assumed the presidency.

Phillips Canada Files Complaint Regarding Proposed Increase In Keystone Tolls | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Responding to a complaint from Phillips 66 Canada Ltd. about a proposed 22.5 per cent increase in 2020 variable tolls on the Keystone Canadian pipeline system, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has determined the revised tolls should be interim as of Jan. 1, 2020.
Phillips Canada had asked the CER to suspend the revised Canadian tariff and to establish a public proceeding to examine and consider whether the rates, or tolls, proposed to be charged by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd. (TC Canada) through the revised Canadian Tariff are just and reasonable.
The CER also is inviting comments from shippers and potential shippers on the matters raised by the complaint and the process, if any, that should be used to further consider the complaint.
TC Canada has not provided “sufficient or timely supporting factual or financial information”  to enable shippers to determine whether the costs included in the variable toll and the resulting increases are appropriate or whether the 2020 variable tolls are just and reasonable, says Phillips Canada in its complaint.
Husky Oil Operations Limited and Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC in letters to the CER support Phillips 66.
TC Canada on Nov. 29, 2019, filed a revised Canadian tariff for 2020 that includes a proposal to increase variable tolls by approximately 22.5 per cent.
Phillips US, the shipper on the United States segment of Keystone, also has filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regarding the proposed increase of seven per cent in variable tolls, effective Jan. 1, 2020.
“The 2020 variable tolls represent a disproportionate and unprecedented increase in costs since the Keystone Pipeline System first became operational,” says Phillips Canada.
In its complaint to the CER, it says TC Canada gave notice of the revised tariff Nov. 29, 2019. The accompanying spreadsheet detailed the calculation of the estimated variable tolls, including a 50 per cent increase in forecast operating and maintenance to be recovered through the toll, but provided no explanation for the increase, according to Phillips Canada.
Nearly two weeks later, TC Canada provided a letter indicating that the proposed increase in 2020 variable tolls is mostly attributable to unspecified costs arising from “2019 incidents,” says Phillips Canada.  In particular, it says, TC Canada suggested the following categories of costs would be incurred:

Incident related to inspection, repairs and remediation;
Increased preventative maintenance programs; and,
Utilization of drag reducing agents to mitigate impacts on throughput.

TC Canada in its Dec. 12, 2019 letter says the 2020 variable toll would have increased by less than one per cent, absent the unspecified “2019 incidents,” the company notes.
Phillips Canada says that in the absence of sufficient information to justify the variable tolls and given TC’s limited explanation for the proposed toll increases, it is concerned the increases may have included estimated OM&A (operating, maintenance and administration) costs “that have been, or will be incurred as a result of TC Energy’s own negligence, that of its subsidiaries or agents, or as a result of the wrongful acts or omissions of presently unknown third-parties.”
In its complaint, the company says that while TC Canada suggests that 2019 incidents are responsible for most of the increase in tolls, it has provided minimal information about the incidents. Phillips Canada said it believes that some of the costs of these 2019 incidents may be related to, or caused by prior incidents, including the pipeline rupture that occurred in November 2017 near Amherst, South Dakota, or other pipeline leak events.
Phillips Canada says it believes “it would be improper” for TC Canada to collect variable tolls from its shippers with respect to the “so-called 2019 incidents (or other prior incidents)” if TC Energy, its subsidiaries or agents were responsible for causing some or all of these incidents or if the company or its subsidiaries have or may recover compensation from third-parties, including insurers, who are, or may be held, legally responsible.
“These incident costs should not typically be considered as routine operations, maintenance and administration costs incurred by the pipeline for the provision of service to its customers under the TSA [transportation service agreement],” it says. “Incidents costs, as Phillips Canada currently understands them, are not caused by the transportation of oil on the pipeline.”
Non-routine adjustment 
To the extent the increase in variable costs can legitimately be passed through to shippers as operation and maintenance costs, Phillips Canada says it is concerned that some or all of the incident costs constitute a “non-routine adjustment” (NRA) where the maintenance costs and expenses associated with any single expenditure (s) with respect to the same or a common matter or project exceed $2 million.
The company says it is aware of two leaks in 2019 on the Keystone US system — one in  Missouri in February and one in North Dakota in October — and that it believes that the costs of maintaining and repairing these leaks would, in each case, have cost more than US$2 million. “If so, pursuant to the NRA clause, the costs of addressing these leaks may need to be amortized in accordance with good accounting practices instead of the entire cost being included in the variable toll in a single year — assuming that the cost of these leaks qualifies as an appropriate cost to be included in the variable toll in the first place, which they may not.”
Given that OM&A (operating maintenance and administration) expenses are forecast to increase by $94 million in 2020 (C$51.9 million allocated to Keystone Canada and US$42.1million allocated to Keystone US) and two-thirds of that is supposedly attributable to 2019 incidents, Phillips says it believes some, or perhaps all, of any other 2019 costs may be subject to the NRA clause.
Drag reducing agents
Phillips Canada says it also is concerned that proposed increased expenditures on drag reducing agents (DRA) amounts to a subsidization of expanded capacity on the Keystone pipeline system to allow for the transportation of increased overall volumes.
The company says it understands that, in part, the use of DRAs is meant to compensate for temporarily reduced pipeline pressure on sections of the Keystone US pipeline to the north and south of the North Dakota leak which has reduced the volume of crude that can be transported. However, Phillips Canada is concerned that once this temporary restriction is lifted, “existing shippers will be subsidizing the DRA that TC Energy will use to bring new shippers onto the system.”

First Nation Looks Ahead After Court Sides With Natural Gas Company | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — A hereditary chief with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation says the community is expecting further police action after the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled in favour of a natural gas company that wants to build a pipeline through its territory.
Na’moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale, said he wasn't surprised that the court granted Coastal GasLink an interim injunction against members of the First Nation and others who oppose the pipeline.
The Dec. 31 ruling came just under a year after the RCMP enforced an injunction granted by the same court that drew international attention with the arrest of 14 people on Jan. 7, 2019.
“We do expect the RCMP to bring it to another level. They did it last year, they’ll do it again this year,” he said in a telephone interview.
The RCMP said in a statement that it respects the ruling and the judicial process, but it would not say if or when police would enforce the latest injunction.
“The RCMP respects the rights of individuals to peaceful, lawful and safe protest and we are committed to facilitating a dialogue between all parties. We are impartial in this dispute and it is our hope that this can be resolved peacefully,” Corp. Madonna Saunders said.
The $6.6-billion Coastal GasLink pipeline would transport natural gas across 670 kilometres from northeastern B.C. to the LNG Canada export terminal in Kitimat.
The company has said it signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nations councils along the path, however five hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suweten First Nation say the project has no authority without their consent.
Na’moks said the First Nation is also exploring options for court action, including an appeal of the decision and a constitutional challenge.
“We have a number of avenues open to us that we're looking at right now.”
The latest ruling expands the existing interim injunction.
Following police enforcement last year, the hereditary chiefs reached an agreement with RCMP that Na'moks said at the time was to ensure the safety of local members. Under the agreement, the company must give the First Nation 24-hour notice of workers entering the site, he said.
The agreement did not represent consent for the project and Na’moks said members remain firm in their opposition.
“Our stance hasn't changed,'' he said Thursday. “Our people have said no to this, so we’ve said no.”
Over the past year, Coastal GasLink has begun what it calls pre-construction work at the site, drawing criticism from members of the First Nation who say that work threatens or destroys historic artifacts, trails and hunting grounds.
The company issued a statement following the court ruling saying its work is approved and permitted.
Coastal GasLink will continue trying “to engage with any affected groups to ensure public safety while (its) field crews continue to progress their critical activities,” it said.
Unist’ot’en spokeswoman Freda Huson, who is named in the injunction, said the court decision fails to recognize the authority of Wet’suwet’en law even though the First Nation has never ceded its territory.
According to the decision, Indigenous laws do not become an “effectual part” of Canadian common law or domestic law until there is a means or process to do so that is already recognized by Canadian law, such as through treaties, Aboriginal title declarations in the courts or statutory provisions.
That has not occurred in the Wet’suwet’en case, it said.
Wet’suwet’en title claims have not been resolved by either litigation or negotiation, the decision said.
The court also said some of the constitutional questions posed by the Wet’suwet’en go beyond the scope of the injunction application. It said those questions would have to be determined in a trial.
Huson has lived on the land in question for a decade and what started as a camp now has several permanent structures, including space that is used as a healing centre, which she said she will keep running.
“We’ll continue to exercise Wet’suwet’en law, it’s what has sustained us,” she said.
“We’re not feeling defeated because we know what we’re doing is right.”

B.C. Supreme Court Grants Coastal GasLink Interlocutory Injunction | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — The British Columbia Supreme Court has granted Coastal GasLink an interlocutory injunction against members of a First Nation and others who oppose the company’s natural gas pipeline.
The company is building a pipeline from northeastern B.C. to LNG Canada’s export terminal in Kitimat on the coast.
Coastal GasLink says it has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nations councils along the 670-kilometres route but hereditary chiefs in the Wet’suwet’en First Nation say the project has no authority without their consent.
The court had granted the company an interim injunction last December against pipeline opponents and protests erupted when RCMP enforced it in January, arresting 14 people along a logging road leading to the construction site near Houston, B.C.
In her ruling Tuesday, Justice Marguerite Church said Coastal GasLink has the permits and authorizations for the project and has satisfied the requirements for an interlocutory injunction.
She said there is evidence to indicate that the defendants have engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct for the purpose of causing harm to the plaintiff and preventing it from constructing the pipeline.
“There is a public interest in upholding the rule of law and restraining illegal behaviour and protecting of the right of the public, including the plaintiff, to access on Crown roads,” she wrote.
“The defendants may genuinely believe in their rights under Indigenous law to prevent the plaintiff from entering Dark House territory, but the law does not recognize any right to blockade and obstruct the plaintiff from pursuing lawfully authorized activities.”
In a statement, Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs representing all five clans of the First Nation said they “reject” the B.C. Supreme Court decision.
The First Nation said it is disappointed that the court rendered a decision that contradicts Wet’suwet’en law.
“Coastal GasLink has never obtained consent from the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs to enter or work on our territories,” the statement said.
“Under the threat of continued police violence, the Wet’suwet’en have complied with the interim injunction order imposed throughout our territories.”
Coastal GasLink said in a statement that it remains focused on constructing the $6.6-billion project safely and with respect to its Indigenous partners and local communities along the route.
“We are proud of the relationships we’ve built with all 20 First Nations along the corridor, the significant benefits we continue to deliver to Indigenous and local communities, and the role we are playing in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions,” the statement said.
“Coastal GasLink will continue to abide by the terms of the access protocol agreed with Dark House and the Unist’ot’en Camp for access beyond the Morice River bridge and will continue efforts to engage with any affected groups to ensure public safety while our field crews continue to progress their critical activities.”
The company contends the pipeline will deliver significant, long-term benefits for Indigenous and northern B.C. communities along its path and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by providing natural gas to replace coal burning in Asian markets.
Church said in her decision there is “evidence of significant harm” to the company and others if the pipeline project cannot go ahead because of the blockades, including Coastal GasLink’s contractors and sub-contractors.
“There would be loss of employment opportunities for employees involved in the construction of the export facility and its operation, employees involved in the construction of the pipeline project, and loss of opportunity for members of Indigenous communities to take advantage of training and employment,” she wrote.
The evidence before her was “not clear” on the harm that would be brought to the Wet’suwet’en nation, she said.
“There is considerable disagreement among members of the Wet’suwet’en nation with respect to the pipeline project and many in the community who support the pipeline project and are of the view that it will have substantial benefits to the Wet’suwet’en nation as a whole.”
Church also said this is an appropriate case to include enforcement provisions within the injunction order, to inform the public of the consequences of non-compliance.
Activities at the Unist’ot’en Camp have continued since the interim injunction and the company is not seeking to restrain the defendants from continuing to occupy the Unist’ot’en camp, operating their healing centre or otherwise using their traditional territories, provided that they do not block or prevent use of the roads or interfere with the plaintiff's construction activities, she said.
“The interlocutory injunction order would only prevent the defendants from blocking the roads when construction activities are underway,” Church wrote.
Those opposed to the pipeline did not challenge the validity of the company’s permits and authorizations through legal means but rather chose to pursue “unlawful self-help remedies” to further their goal of preventing construction, she said in her decision.
“Use of self-help remedies is contrary to the rule of law and is an abuse of process,” she said.

Pakistan To Start Building LNG Pipeline With Russia In July | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– Pakistan will start building a 1,100-kilometre pipeline in July with Russia that will allow the South Asian nation to operate more liquefied natural gas terminals.
The South Asian nation will have a majority share of 51 per cent to 74 per cent in the project, while Russia will own the remainder, Nadeem Babar, petroleum adviser to the prime minister, said in an interview on Dec. 14. Pakistan’s gas distribution companies Sui Southern Gas Co. and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd., which have started acquiring land for the pipeline, will be a part of the project, while a Russian consortium will lead construction.
Pakistan has become one of the top emerging markets for the super-chilled fuel in recent years as domestic gas production has plateaued, forcing the nation to import cargoes. The nation has also auctioned a record 20 oil and gas blocks to encourage exploration activity, with bids expected by mid-January, said Babar.
Pakistan, which imported its first cargo five years ago, currently has two LNG terminals. It’s running the two terminals at capacity to meet peak winter demand, with 12 cargoes secured for December and 11 for January, Babar said. Two more LNG terminals, Energas and Mitsubishi’s Tabeer Energy, are expected to start in the next few years.
Pakistan has LNG deals for 700 mmcf/d and Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government will decide if the nation needs another medium-term LNG contract for five years after reviewing demand from power generators, the biggest consumers of the fuel, in the next three months, said Babar.
The nation has also decided that it will only import cleaner Euro-5 diesel from January after doing the same for gasoline earlier this year. Besides imports, Pakistan also plans to add 150 mmcf/d of domestic gas output this month, including 50 mmcf/d from the Mari gas field, Babar said.

Contract ‘Terminated’ For TMX Spread 5B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Macro Enterprises Inc. reported that Macro Spiecapag Trans Mountain Joint Venture, its 50/50 joint venture with Spiecapag Canada Corp., received a notice of termination from Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. to “terminate for cause” the construction contract for Spread 5B of the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline project due to ongoing challenges between the joint venture and Trans Mountain.
“Macro and Trans Mountain continue to be in discussions regarding future opportunities that are expected to contractually occur in early 2021,” the company stated.
Meanwhile, the company has completed the reorganization plan, announced Nov. 27, 2020, related to the Coastal GasLink pipeline project. In addition, Macro received a closing cash payment of $20 million, and is to receive a further $20 million payment on June 30, 2020, in satisfaction of all amounts owing to Macro by the CGL joint venture.
Macro has agreed to continue to provide support to Spiecapag on the CGL project by providing equipment and personnel to assist Spiecapag to complete that project. The company will be paid market-based rates and fees for such equipment and personnel.
The company remains on target to meet its fiscal 2020 annual revenue guidance of $250 million reported in its third quarter MD&A. This estimate considers the company's current core business underway and a pro-rata portion of its joint venture interests at the closing of the above-discussed reorganization plan. Margins are expected to remain consistent with the previous nine months reported for this year.

Consolidation Versus Collaboration: Energy Associations Consider Their Interrelationships | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
This is the first part in a three-part series this week on industry associations.

Consolidation has been picking up in the Canadian oilpatch lately, which begs the question: Could this trend carry over to industry associations?
At the very least, say association heads, collaboration will be important in matters of shared concern.
Timothy Egan, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Gas Association (CGA), said collaboration has always been vital for his group. He noted this sort of collaboration has increased dramatically during the pandemic as associations recognized that many elected officials and other decision makers did not have adequate understanding of energy sector needs and concerns.
“We started coming together with other energy trade associations, calling other government officials and saying: ‘Look, what do you think about our giving you a full value-chain briefing?’ They really appreciated that. In fact, we created a loose network of 12 energy associations, which started briefing officials, and particularly federal officials.”
For several months, he noted, these associations have been in regular communication with government. He said this sort of collaboration is something CGA will try to continue beyond the lockdown.
There is not so much a need for consolidation of energy sector associations as there is a need for collaboration, said Canadian Society for Unconventional Resources (CSUR) president and CEO Dan Allan. “It’s more about a stronger collaboration, removing duplication of efforts, and trying to stay focused.”
Although CSUR has some overlap with other organizations, such as the Society for Petroleum Engineers (SPE), Allan suggested that his group is involved in unique discussions (i.e. environment, geoscience or play financing) that venture beyond typical engineering, reservoir or production themes.
 “We think it’s that whole network we bring to the table, along with our very strong interactions with government and universities. We don’t want to abandon that model, and we can’t see us absorbing or being absorbed by someone else. We’re trying not to duplicate efforts. Let’s work with our ‘friends and family’. We advertise our events on our newsletters. A lot of SPE members are our members. I’m [a member] of some of those organizations as well.”
However, he said, the Canadian energy sector is “a much smaller space” given challenging times for the industry in recent years, with each association trying to prove its uniqueness and justify its membership fees against those of other associations, especially during the ongoing pandemic. “We’re finding that will be a real struggle for all of us when it comes down to that budget limitation. Who is going to be forced to survive? That’s a really good question.
“Our membership base and our membership structure was focused on a different world. We used to have these big events and stuff. How can we ask them to pay the same amount when we’re not delivering that same product? That’s true with everyone else.”
In terms of energy association consolidations, Egan said that is always a healthy issue that associations must face. He added CGA works for members who constantly reassess their priorities and position within a marketplace that is changing quickly. Industry associations exist to help advance the interest of members, he suggested, and every company should regularly evaluate the value proposition of their associations.
“Could there be some consolidation? That’s always a possibility. But I think it is also always a possibility that yet new voices will be created, because everyone’s interests are always changing,” he said.
The need for many association voices
When an association such as the Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) is speaking on behalf of several companies and thousands of workers, it can be more impactful than a lone company presenting its challenges to government, noted Elizabeth Aquin, interim president and CEO.
“And so, during this particular time, it is incredibly important. We continue to advocate and provide value to our members by speaking to provincial and federal governments on issues and the measures that’ll assist them in surviving. This was the sixth year of a downturn that was even more exacerbated by the pandemic.”
Aquin told the DOB there is no overabundance of associations representing the energy sector, but the fewer groups there are does equate to more significant representation for any of the groups remaining.
She said: “Given current economic circumstances, conversations around consolidation may take place and would certainly be worthwhile to look at — just as companies are doing — that could potentially benefit from economies of scale or resources. It always makes sense to look at your environment and see if there are better ways of doing things.”
John Bayko, vice-president of communications with the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC), told the Bulletin in an email response that his group is not looking at consolidation necessarily, but rather it is interested in “right-sizing” to better represent OFS around the wellhead. The association recently announced that it will introduce a new directional drilling division in 2021.
“We look forward to listening to and supporting the Canadian directional drilling industry as we navigate through challenging times,” Mark Scholz, president and CEO, told CAODC’s virtual state of the industry event. The decision to add a directional drilling division is an outcome from a strategic review earlier this year.
Scholz added: “This is our chance to build on our collective future and the future of energy in Canada. It’s about managing through the uncertainty of our world and charting a new course.”
According to Bayko, the last several years have been challenging for CAODC members, and “very eye-opening” in terms of the association validating that it is strong and effective. He said the cost savings, government relations and advocacy initiatives the CAODC has executed on behalf of industry are very important, as they give energy workers, as well as their families, a strong and respected voice on the public stage.
The oil and gas sector (along with its various associations) continues to collaborate on issues of common interest, Aquin added. She noted the relationship between the oil and gas companies and the services sector is very symbiotic, since most factors that impact one set of companies will impact the other, and it makes sense for the relevant energy associations to work together for the mutual benefit of all.
“For example, when the services sector goes to government, we help them understand that many of the issues the oil and gas companies may bring forward … are not just going to affect ‘Big Oil.’ They’ll also have an impact on oilfield services — a national supply chain across Canada that includes manufacturing in Ontario and Québec, and supports over 530,000 workers across the country.”
She added: “There are a lot of Canadian jobs at stake. The other thing, I think, is that while there are lots of activists and folks out there who think we can just transition to renewables overnight, where you find opposition to oil and gas, the collaboration on energy literacy is very helpful in those efforts as well.”
Fundamentally, the role of trade associations is to represent stakeholders, and within the energy sector, different associations represent all kinds of different issues, with upstream oilsands (for example) requiring much different representation than do pipeline companies, according to Chris Bloomer, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA).
“We’re a massive linear structure right across the continent, and so the scope is much different,” he said, adding governments and stakeholders want to engage not necessarily with individual companies, but with a sector broadly from the perspective of policy, regulations, and other fiscal issues. “It’s important to have that one voice that can put forward the issues to the stakeholders, government, et cetera, and the need is stronger now than it has ever been.”
Representation needs of producers
For the upstream energy sector, consolidation is not necessarily the right approach for the relevant associations, Tristan Goodman, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC), told the DOB. He believes the key thing for these groups is ensuring they can advance government policies that support members, and adequately advocate on behalf of members with Canadians broadly.
“One of the ways you become effective leading an association is to have what I call ‘razor focus,’” he said. “And so, you really focus on the most important thing, rather than trying to boil the ocean. Obviously, sometimes that doesn’t meet everyone’s expectations, but when you’re really focused, you obviously can get increased results just due to time being spent on something, learning what’s working and what doesn’t.”
He added: “There is a desperate need — and a critical shift that has occurred — for strong, competent, professional government-type advocacy, similar to what you’ll see in other jurisdictions around the world. Governments at all levels are becoming increasingly important to the long-term viability of not just the energy space, but many businesses.”
Tim McMillan, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said that the industry association space in Canada is not large, and current associations all play a specific role for their members. In the U.S., he noted, energy firms are often members of multiple related trade associations at the state and national level.
“For example, a company operating in Texas and Colorado may belong to those two state oil and gas associations as well as the national American Petroleum Institute,” he added. “Here in Canada, we have less overlap within the industry. What we do see is collaboration and co-operation among the natural gas and oil related associations.”
Companies will increasingly benefit from strong industry associations advocating on their behalf, according to Goodman, as speaking with a collective voice makes it easier for governments to absorb.
“They handle it even more, by the way, when you get collective voice across associations, and when you get a lot of the same messages, approaches and solutions being proposed by multiple associations, which means thousands of companies. They really have a better understanding of where to focus their energy.”
For McMillan, the role of an industry association is to build consensus among members and effectively advocate on their behalf. “To stay relevant now and into the future we must be able to do this efficiently and keep offering more to our members than they can achieve alone.”
Goodman said EPAC collaborates significantly with many associations. “That’s where our focus is on making sure we’re trying to align where we can, and understand other points of view. It is obviously much more effective when there are more voices.”
He added: “That being said, every association has its own approach that it goes about, and in some cases actually associations are seeing the future and approach to advocacy a little differently. In those cases, we can beg to differ with folks, and we respect those differences and continue advocating in the way we think is the best approach.”
Meanwhile, the transmission pipeline sector has changed dramatically over the last few years, with “companies buying other companies,” altering the potential membership for CEPA, Bloomer told the DOB.
However, he said, utilization and engagement with the association’s membership remains consistent and strong, with safety as a key concern within the sector.
“When we look at that, strategically, we have strategic meetings with our members, and they see that advocacy is really the key role for our association. It’s the same thing for other associations. We meet quarterly amongst ourselves, and we share what’s going on in our world.”
The industry associations are moving to a model where on fundamental issues, there is more collaboration and co-advocacy. This applies to policy items that transcend the individual sectors within the industry and apply to the members of all these associations.
“That’s kind of where that’s evolving. Strategically, that’s very important given COVID, the state of the industry, and being able to communicate as a group is much more powerful. We saw that in how we engaged on Bill C-69.”
Consolidation matters in the renewable space
In July, the Canadian Wind Energy Association (CanWEA) and the Canadian Solar Industries Association (CanSIA) unified to form the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CREA) — an expanded association that includes energy storage, launched against the backdrop of the global pandemic and a debate in Canada regarding an acceleration of the ongoing transition to a cleaner, low-carbon economy.
Alison Thompson, chair and CEO of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA), told the DOB these two associations share a lot of “common ground” and can deliver a lot of advocacy as a single entity. She also said that the fact CanGEA was not invited to join CREA demonstrates just how different a product geothermal is.
“For many years it has been very obvious that we provide baseload — we operate all the time. We’re much like a coal or nuclear plant, or large hydro. Wind and solar have a very large footprint now in the industry, and so they are participating in an important way, but they’ve always had that intermittency. It’s their challenge. We don’t have that challenge. And so, it’s wrong to assume all renewables are very aligned.”
Calling the combined entity the ‘Canadian Renewable Energy Association’ might not be the best branding, said Thompson, because wind and solar alone do not represent the entirety of renewables in Canada. “However, that is totally fine. They’re making great strides. We don’t feel left out.”
According to Thompson, CanGEA feels its members to be more of a natural extension of the subsurface industry and energy, which can be clean. Canadians may be more likely to identify geothermal with the oil and gas than with renewables, Thompson noted, which is fine considering CanGEA’s head office is in Calgary. She said her association continues to extend an invitation to collaborate with other energy associations in championing common goals.
Reasons for optimism
Despite the challenges facing Canada’s energy sector, given the ongoing COVID-19 downturn and impact of lower oil prices and reduced activity in 2020, the associations representing companies and workers within the industry remain optimistic about the future of that industry.
For example, Aquin said that she is definitely optimistic about the future for her association, its members, as well as the OFS sector and oil and gas industry overall. “Yes, we’re going through an extremely challenging time right now, and advocacy is critical at a time like this, but the world continues to need oil and gas.”
She added: “As we transition, we’re still going to need the service sector for all of its innovation and technology development. Many of the oilfield services companies right now are benefiting from our advocacy, for example, like we did related to orphan and inactive wells that resulted in these last several years in more than $2 billion of funding.”
As with any organization, scarcity of resources is a reality for EPAC, said Goodman. However, while there is concern for the future, there is also tremendous opportunity for his organization and its members. Companies must adapt to current realities for the energy sector.
“It’s obviously a challenging period for everybody in the energy space, and no association is immune from that. That said, it’s very clear that the associations have an increased level of work simply due to the incredible amount of activity of all governments — federal, provincial and municipal.
“What we’re seeing is a tremendous volume of policy changes where there’s a need and desire on the part of industry to make sure they have representation on those [energy] files at the most senior levels into government.”
For EPAC, there have been some “minor changes in membership” given challenges facing the energy sector, said Goodman. Generally, though, its members remain committed to EPAC’s work on their behalf. “I think they are seeing results as a consequence of the actions, which is obviously positive for those members.”
According to Aquin, companies within the energy sector will continue to look to associations such as PSAC to help them speak with governments in order to ensure there are measures in place to help see industry through difficult times, leading to a healthier sector in the future. “I absolutely think there’s a role for associations, and there’ll continue to be a role, and I’m definitely positive about the future of oil and gas for many, many years to come.”

"Two Deferred Projects Reactivated, Petrochemical Plant Suspended Indefinitely, Says Pembina | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Pembina Pipeline Corporation has set a 2021 capital budget of $730 million as it reactivates two previously deferred growth projects, a revised Phase VII Peace Pipeline expansion and Empress co-generation facility, although a joint venture petrochemical project has been suspended indefinitely.
The capital program is fully funded by cash flow from operating activities after dividends at the low end of the adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, said Pembina.
“After a challenging 2020, there is a renewed sense of focus and optimism at Pembina,” said Pembina management.  “In responding decisively to the COVID-19 pandemic, we effectively 'hit the pause button' and there is a sense of being able to 'hit play' again in early 2021 given progress on numerous vaccines and an expectation of a return to some economic normalcy.”
Pembina's Pipelines Division capital investments of $540 million will be primarily related to the construction of Phase VII, in addition to remaining capital to be spent on projects previously placed into service and smaller growth projects including various new laterals and terminals.
The $140 million allocated to the Facilities Division will be focused on completion of the Prince Rupert Terminal, the Empress Co-generation facility and the Vancouver Wharves diesel handling expansion project.
Marketing and New Ventures Division capital investments of $25 million will be focused on ongoing regulatory and permitting requirements related to the Jordan Cove LNG project and advancing Pembina's remaining portfolio of unsecured development opportunities.
The company also said that it and its joint venture partner, Petrochemical Industries Company K.S.C. (PIC), have suspended execution of the integrated propane dehydration (PDH) plant and polypropylene upgrading facility project indefinitely. The decision was made due to the significant risks arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, most notably with respect to project costs, said Pembina. The partners, though, continue to evaluate the project through their joint venture, Canada Kuwait Petrochemical Limited Partnership (CKPC), said Pembina.
As a result of the uncertainty, in the fourth quarter of 2020 Pembina will recognize a material impairment on its investment in CKPC.
Phase VII Peace Pipeline expansion 
Pembina said the initial capacity of the Phase VII Peace Pipeline expansion has been revised to optimize the scope with customers' current development plans and transportation requirements. The cost of the project will decline to $775 million from $950 as the initial capacity has been reduced to 160,000 bbls/d from 240,000 bbls/d. The lower capital cost reflects fewer pump stations, as well as additional savings achieved through value engineering and an optimized construction and procurement strategy.
Pembina had invested approximately $300 million, or 40 per cent, in the project as of Sept. 30, 2020. It now anticipates Phase VII will be in service in the first half of 2023.
Phase VII includes a new 20-inch, pipeline and associated infrastructure in the Lag lace-Valleyview-Fox Creek corridor and is aimed at meeting transportation needs arising from the growth of condensate supply in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
Pembina said its decision to re-commence construction of Phase VII was based on extensive discussions with its producing customers that confirmed both the need for, and the timing of, Phase VII. Additionally, the discussions confirmed that beyond 2021, there is growing customer demand for transportation services to support development of the Montney resource play, particularly within the liquids-rich LaGlace to Kakwa corridor and northeast British Columbia, it said.
Once Phase VII is complete, Pembina will have 1.1 million bbls/d of Edmonton area market delivery capacity across its Peace and Northern pipeline systems. Through the re-scoping of Phase VII, Pembina has maintained the ability to reach the previously envisioned ultimate capacity of the Peace system, and said it plans to pursue this through a more measured, capital efficient, economic and orderly expansion program focused on higher utilization rates, making the entire system even more competitive.
As part of the discussions undertaken with customers, Pembina has renegotiated terms with certain customers to align long-term objectives and ultimately secure an additional nearly 600,000 net acres through area-of-dedication agreements (AODs) or similar instruments, resulting in production from more than two million acres of total land now dedicated to the Peace Pipeline system. Much of the production is behind third-party midstream processing plants, whose volumes may have otherwise been available to flow on proposed competing projects.
In addition, Pembina's joint-venture entity, Veresen Midstream, has secured an option from two key customers for NGL extraction rights on up to 750 mmcf/d of natural gas. If Veresen exercises the option, the 15-year agreement would allow for incremental ethane-plus mix of approximately 50,000 bbls/d.
New integrated service offering
Pembina said it has entered, directly and through its joint venture affiliates, into long-term, take-or-pay agreements with Pipestone Energy Corp.  for a fully integrated service offering, including natural gas gathering and processing by Veresen Midstream and liquids transportation and fractionation services by Pembina. Pipestone Energy has also committed to acquire, subject to availability and compliance with regulatory and tariff requirements, long-term natural gas transportation on Alliance Pipeline.
The arrangement will utilize available firm capacity at Veresen Midstream's Hythe expansion project and is underpinned by approximately 10-year take-or-pay contracts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. Volumes are expected to flow in advance of the commencement of the contracts, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Hythe expansion project is now fully committed, said Pembina.
Empress co-generation 
Pembina, the majority owner and operator of the Empress NGL extraction facility, said it has acquired an additional 11.25 per cent interest in the plant, providing it with 135 mmcf/d of incremental ethane-plus extraction capacity at the facility.
Pembina, the majority owner and operator of the Empress NGL extraction facility, also is proceeding with the restart of the co-generation facility at Empress with an expected capital cost of $120 million. About 10 per cent had been spent as of Sept. 30, 2020.
The revised expected in-service date is now the first quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory and environmental approvals.
While the project was deferred, Pembina maintained the necessary level of investment to ensure it remained 'shovel ready', with turbine fabrication now complete and delivery scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2020. The project is trending under budget, having gone through a value engineering exercise during the project deferral period.
The Empress co-generation facility will be Pembina’s second co-generation project following the successful development of a co-generation facility at the Redwater Complex.
Pembina said it is evaluating two additional opportunities for co-generation facilities at other locations, which would allow it to predictably reduce operating costs as well as continue to reduce emissions intensity within the Facilities Division.
The company also has acquired an additional 11.25 per cent interest in the Empress NGL extraction plant, providing it with 135 mmcf/d of incremental ethane-plus extraction capacity at the facility.
Conventional Pipelines
Activity in its conventional pipelines business has steadily improved since the second quarter of 2020, following the rapid decline in commodity prices, said Pembina. Physical throughput in November and December remains stable and trending upward. Since the production lows experienced in late April and early May, there has been a recovery of approximately 100,000 bbls/d across its conventional pipeline systems, with 2020 exit rates equaling rates seen at the beginning of 2020.
Pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the Peace Pipeline system while extending many existing contracts in the process. Firm volume commitments will reach approximately one million bbls/d in 2023 and currently, the weighted average term of Peace and Northern pipeline contracts is approximately eight years.
The company said it has minimal contracts expiring on Peace Pipeline in 2021 and continues to progress the renewal of the legacy Phase I and II contracts, which have staggered expiries through to 2027. Pembina has successfully renewed or replaced the Phase I and II contracts that expired in 2019 and 2020 and remains highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed, or their firm capacity resold, thus preserving the current earnings profile.
Value engineering work is ongoing on the Phase VIII and IX Peace Pipeline expansions and given strong customer interest, Pembina said it expects to make a decision in 2021 to re-activate the expansions which remain deferred.
Pembina said it expects to take a material impairment on its investment in the Ruby Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2020. As of Sept. 30, 2020, the carrying value of its investment in Ruby was $1.3 billion.
Prince Rupert Terminal expansion
Construction of the Prince Rupert Terminal is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021.
Engineering of the expansion is well advanced, and Pembina expects to make a final investment decision in the first half of 2021. The evaluation of the project now contemplates incremental volumes of 25,000 bbls/d as well as the use of mid-size gas carriers, which would increase the vessel capacity to 250,000 bbls from 150,000 bbls. This would improve economies of scale and competitiveness of the facility by lowering per unit lifting and vessel transport costs to premium markets, said Pembina.
 In addition, the mid-size gas carriers are fully refrigerated, opening up additional opportunities to serve markets with fully refrigerated terminals, as well as continuing to service other niche markets with smaller, semi-refrigerated handy-size ships.
Pembina's rail yard in Redwater is built for unit train capability that provides unique transportation, logistics and cost advantages to Pembina, and will cost-effectively supply the anticipated growth of the terminal.
2021 guidance
Based on the company's expectations and outlook for 2021, Pembina is anticipating adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 to $3.4 billion. Relative to 2020, adjusted EBITDA next year will be positively affected by approximately $1 billion of new assets that will have entered service in 2020 and during the first quarter of 2021, including the Phase VI Peace Pipeline Expansion, Duvernay III, fractionation and terminalling facilities at the Empress NGL Extraction Facility, the Hythe developments project and the Prince Rupert Terminal.
The contribution from new assets will be partially offset by a lower contribution from Ruby Pipeline and the Edmonton South Rail Terminal, and the currently prevailing outlook for a stronger Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, in 2021. Pembina has hedged approximately 50 per cent of its 2021 frac spread exposure, excluding Aux Sable, having systematically entered into hedges throughout 2019 and 2020.
The outlook for 2021 also reflects $100 million of sustained cost savings achieved in 2020. A major focus in 2021 will be extending and enhancing 2020 cost savings and efficiencies into 2021 and beyond, said the company.
Pembina said it intends to make an application for a normal course issuer bid, which would enable the repurchase of up to five percent of its outstanding common shares over a 12-month period.

Cochin Pipeline Expansion Eyed By Pembina | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Pembina Pipeline Corporation says it is advancing commercial discussions, including potential open seasons, for incremental capacity on its Cochin condensate pipeline, subject to customary regulatory and other approvals, as required.
The company said it has evaluated the capacity of the Cochin Pipeline which runs from Fort Saskatchewan to Chicago and has identified opportunities to increase the capacity of the system by up to 50 per cent. Of this, 25,000 could be added with little to no capital requirements while another 25,000 bbls/d could be added by investing modest capital in integrity and other upgrades of the system, it said.
The Cochin system has a design capacity of up to 110,000 bbls/d.
Pembina said it also has been approached about several opportunities to reactivate the idle east leg of the Cochin Pipeline system with various service offerings.
In combination with potential capacity increases, Pembina is evaluating new connections near Chicago, in the Bakken in North Dakota and Hardisty and Empress in Alberta to add high quality condensate and to diversify receipt locations on the system. The combination of Peace, Cochin, Drayton Valley and Redwater condensate, all connected to Pembina's Canadian diluent hub, provides superior flexibility, flow assurance and enhanced value to Pembina customers across North America, said the company.

Inter Pipeline Plans $1 Billion Capital Program | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Inter Pipeline Ltd. plans to spend $1 billion in capital for 2021.
Approximately $930 million, or 93 per cent, of total capital expenditures will be for organic growth initiatives, with the remainder invested in sustaining capital projects.
NGL processing and the Heartland Petrochemical Complex
Within the NGL processing business segment, capital investment is primarily focused on the final stages of construction of the Heartland Petrochemical Complex (HPC). In 2021, approximately $800 million is expected to be invested in this project, with final installation of equipment and processing systems at the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and polypropylene (PP) facilities scheduled for completion by year end.
Specifically, the PDH facility is expected to be substantially mechanically complete by May 2021 with commissioning and operational readiness work planned for the remainder of the year. The PP plant is expected to be mechanically complete by the end of 2021. Start-up for the integrated complex is planned for early 2022.
An additional $60 million will be invested to support the development of other small capital growth projects in the NGL processing segment, including the completion of storage cavern work at the Redwater Olefinic Fractionator and certain control systems upgrades. 
Oilsands transportation & conventional oil pipelines
For 2021, approximately $45 million is planned for overall investment across the pipeline transportation systems. Inter Pipeline's oilsands transportation business will receive approximately $25 million in 2021 with a focus on improving operating efficiencies for the Cold Lake, Polaris and Corridor pipeline systems.
Approximately $20 million will be directed to Inter Pipeline's conventional oil pipeline business, which will support optimization of Hardisty South on the Bow River system and includes additional enhancement measures on the Viking Connector and Stettler expansion projects. The Viking Connector was placed into service on April 1, 2020 and is a 75 kilometre pipeline connecting Inter Pipeline's Throne Station on the Bow River pipeline system to the Central Alberta pipeline system in the Stettler area.
Bulk liquid storage
Inter Pipeline is planning to spend approximately $10 million in 2021 at our storage facilities in Sweden and Denmark on several small efficiency projects.
Sustaining capital
Inter Pipeline expects to invest approximately $70 million in sustaining capital expenditures in 2021. Approximately $45 million is allocated to NGL processing and includes scheduled maintenance and turnaround activities at the Redwater Olefinic Fractionator, Pioneer I and II offgas plants, which are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2021. The remaining $25 million will be allocated to a variety of smaller enhancement projects across our pipeline transportation businesses and bulk liquid storage assets. 
Financing
At Nov. 30, 2020, Inter Pipeline's $2.5 billion of committed revolving credit facilities were undrawn. Funding for Inter Pipeline's 2021 capital program is expected to be provided through a combination of undistributed cash flow from operations and available credit capacity.

Nigerian Shell Employees Orchestrated Oil Spills For Own Profit-Dutch TV | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Employees at Royal Dutch Shell plc's Nigerian joint venture orchestrated damage to oil pipelines to profit from the money spent on clean-up operations, Dutch investigative TV program Zembla reported on Thursday.
Employees of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) recruited local youth to sabotage the pipelines and then hired them back as workers to clean up the mess, the report said, citing research by Dutch environmental group Milieudefensie.
Shell's SPDC said it investigates all credible reports of misconduct and takes action where needed.
""As of now, we are not aware of any staff or contractor having been involved in acts causing oil spills in the Niger Delta,"" it said in a reaction sent to Reuters via Shell's Dutch head office.
The Dutch Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Shell officials and the Dutch ambassador to Nigeria were made aware of the matter by local leaders in 2018, but did not act on those warnings, Zembla said.
Milieudefensie said in a statement on Thursday its research centred on the village of Ikarama, where it said there had been 30 spills in the last 13 years. ""The majority of the leaks in Ikarama were the result of instructions given by Shell Nigeria employees,"" it said.
The profit made on the cleaning operations was split between SPDC employees and the youths, Zembla said, citing statements provided to police and Nigeria’s Ikarama Youth Council by witnesses and people who said they or their family members had taken part.
The program did not provide any figures on how much profit was allegedly made.
Pipeline sabotage is a major source of pollution in the Niger Delta.
In 2019, Royal Dutch Shell's onshore Nigeria subsidiary said it had seen a 41 per cent rise in the number of crude oil spills caused by theft or pipeline sabotage.
Of a total 164 SPDC spills of more than 100 kilograms in the delta, 157 were from theft and sabotage, Shell said.
SPDC is a joint venture of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which holds a 55 per cent stake, Shell, its operator, with 30 per cent, France's Total SA with 10 per cent and Italy's Eni with five per cent.
It produces around one million bbls/d and operates more than 6,000 kilometres of pipelines in the delta.

Enbridge Sees Growth In Export Opportunities For Canadian Heavy Crude Via U.S. Gulf Coast | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Canadian heavy crude could be exported from the United States Gulf of Mexico as exports begin to bounce back to meet growing global crude oil demand, the president of Liquids Pipelines for Enbridge Inc. said Tuesday.
“In the last few months, we've seen renewed interest from global refineries, both in Asia and Europe, to see if they can access heavy crude coming from our network,” Vern Yu, executive vice-president, told the company’s virtual investor day.
“Refinery demand continues to grow as Canadian heavy crude will replace declining global, heavy crude supplies,” he said. Enbridge has moved record volumes of Canadian crude into the Gulf this year, analysts heard.
Another good sign for Canadian heavy crude is the interest global refiners have shown in the ICE system with the dramatic growth over the last year or so in the WCS Houston futures contract, said Yu. “The ability to hedge these barrels competitively will help with the global command competitiveness of the Canadian heavy barrel.”  
While the bulk of exports from the Gulf will be U.S. domestic light crude, the company believes Canadian heavy crude will also play a role as U.S. Gulf Coast exports are forecast to nearly double to six million bbls/d by 2040, he said. In same period, Canadian heavy delivery to the Gulf is projected to increase by 600,000 bbls/d, accounting for 70 per cent of the U.S. Gulf Coast market share.
As crude oil prices firm up in 2021, Enbridge anticipates a “very strong” supply response from Western Canada with the disappearance of self-imposed production curtailments and new supply coming to market, filling up the Enbridge system in the second half of next year, said Yu. “Net-net, we expect a backlog of 600,000 [barrels per day] and that crude will need to get to market.”
In the longer term, even in a moderate price environment of US$50/bbl WTI, the company expects heavy crude production to increase by at least one million bbls/d over the next decade or so.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates even in the most pessimistic oil demand scenario, that more than $20 trillion in oil and gas investments would be required over the next two decades and North America is going to be a very big part of this, he said. “We have abundant low cost supply and the most responsible development practices globally — this is especially true for Canadian heavy crude.”
Enbridge’s key customers in the U.S. Midwest and the U.S. Gulf Coast tend to be complex refineries that need heavy and medium crudes to maximize their returns, said Yu. “Heavy crude processing capability has made these customers much more profitable than their peers globally and as global heavy crude supplies continue to diminish from Mexico and Venezuela, Canadian heavy crude will increase its market share and this will benefit our network.”
The Enbridge system has long-term demand with its pipeline network “hardwired” into its customers in the U.S. Midwest and Eastern Canada, he said. “Effectively, there are no other pipeline alternatives.”
Enbridge also is the largest conduit of heavy Canadian crude into the U.S. Gulf Coast, he said. “With access to the right crude slates, our customers will be profitable and sustainable for decades to come.”
The company expects there will be enough egress out of the western Canadian basin to foster continued production growth once it completes its Line 3 replacement, currently under construction in Minnesota, along with additional mainline optimizations and the completion of one of the two competing pipeline projects (Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL).
Yu said that over the last several years, his team has done a great job of maximizing throughputs on the system. “We've modified our assets, we've optimized our field work, we've employed cutting edge technologies, and all of this has unlocked about 400,000 [barrels a day] of incremental throughput,” he said. “We are quite excited about putting the Minnesota portion of Line 3 into service.  Once this is done, this will give us more flexibility on how we manage crude slates and unlock even more system optimizations.”
Enbridge also has about $5 billion in opportunities for low capital expansions and extensions of its regional oilsands, egress capacity and market access projects, said Yu.
The three intra-Alberta takeaway trunk lines provide good opportunities for economic expansions to meet growing western Canadian production growth, he said.  Forecast oilsands growth requires regional infrastructure of up to 600,000 bbls/d of highly efficient expansions, analysts heard.
Enbridge also has the ability to add another 450,000 bbls/d of egress through Mainline enhancements (200,000 bbls/d), Express pipeline enhancements (100,000 bbls/d) and the potential reversal of the Southern Lights diluent line (150,000 bbls/d) for conversion to crude oil service, said Yu. “We can do all this with more system optimizations and pump station modifications; this means there's very modest permanent requirements and no new pipe in the ground.”  
The company’s market access pipelines, Flanagan South, the Southern Access Extension and Seaway, all have embedded low cost expansion capabilities to bring another 550,000 bbls/d to end markets.
With the completion of Line 3 and the full expansion of Southern Access to 1.2 million bbls/d for about $4 billion, the Enbridge system is going to be balanced with enough capacity to feed all of its core refineries in the U.S. Midwest and match its existing market access pipeline commitments, said Yu. “After that, we see increased U.S. Gulf Coast refinery demand and emerging market demand for North American crude and this is going to provide us more opportunities to expand our footprint along the Gulf Coast.”
 U.S. Gulf Coast Opportunities
With COVID vaccines in sight, Enbridge is seeing customers starting to look at more investment opportunities and while it has seen interest pick up across its entire network, the Gulf has been a particular hotspot, he said. “Shipper interest in the Gulf supports the extension of our pipeline towards the last mile, increasing the reach of Canadian heavy barrels to the coast and ultimately to the Gulf and global markets.”
The company sees about $2 billion of opportunities in terminalling and export infrastructure on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
The 15-million-bbl Enbridge Houston Oil Terminal (EHOT) will provide unique capabilities to store and blend heavy crude oil that will support local U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, said Yu. The terminal will be fully integrated to allow marine access to enable crude oil coming in and out of the Gulf to use the facility.  
Enbridge also is progressing its interest in the SeaPort Oil Terminal (SPOT), a VLCC loading terminal joint venture with Enterprise Products Partners LP.  The company believes this is a “deeply advantaged” export facility as it has access to all of North America's different supply basins, he said. SPOT also has full loading VLCCs capability and is away from the congestion along the Houston Ship Channel.
In addition, Enbridge sees good future opportunities for the Seaway pipeline. Not only is it a critical link in its network as the conduit between Cushing and Houston but more importantly Seaway’s Houston area distribution network allows the integration of EHOT with the Houston area refineries, said Yu. “Seaway will also provide access for crude oil exports through its existing docks at Texas City and Freeport, and in the future to SPOT.”
Strong oil fundamentals 
 Energy fundamentals support Enbridge’s strategy of providing growing volumes of Canadian heavy crude to supply key markets in the U.S. Midwest, the U.S. Gulf Coast and globally, he said. “The factors driving demand in Europe and potentially North America for crude oil are very different than what we see in the emerging markets.”
 Crude oil is a major source of energy globally and is going to be here for decades to come, according to Yu. “We shouldn't forget that it's cheap, it's efficient and is the core building block for plastics,” he said.
“Our customers are globally competitive and will be providing refined products to their customers for decades to come,” he said. “Reliable long life and increasingly cost competitive Canadian heavy crude will provide a structural advantage to these refiners.”
The Canadian heavy crude sector has made great strides on costs and Canadian producers can now break even at extremely low WTI prices, said Yu. “This was evident this year, when we saw western Canadian production bounce back quickly from April's production lows.”
Enbridge’s upstream customers have also become much more capital efficient in their expansions which are now smaller in scale and much more repeatable, such as Cenovus Energy Inc.’s build-out of the Christina Lake and Foster Creek in situ oilsands projects, he said. The debottlenecking of existing operations, such as Imperial Oil Limited’s Kearl mine also can add supply cost efficiently, he said.

Enbridge Hoping It Can Hold Mainline Open Season By Year-end 2021 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc. believes that it’s on track to hold an open season by the end of next year for Mainline transportation capacity should the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) approve its application to convert the Mainline to firm service from common carriage, analysts heard Tuesday.
“Over the last few years, we've been working with our shippers on Mainline contracting and  shippers that represent over 75 per cent of our volumes today continue to support us,” Vern Yu, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines, told the company’s virtual investment day.
Intervenors in support and those opposed to the proposal have filed their evidence in the CER public hearing and with that part of the regulatory process complete, Enbridge is now able to start asking questions of  the opposing side, he said. “This will give us an opportunity to dispel many of the myths surrounding our Mainline contracting offering.”
In the meantime, Enbridge will  use the extension feature in the CTS agreement for tolls in the second half of 2021.
“While we believe Mainline contracting is the best outcome for both our shippers and Enbridge,  … we do have an option to make a cost of service filing with the CER should we get an unfavourable ruling from them on Mainline contracting or if we're not able to garner sufficient shipper commitments,” said Yu.
“We don't think cost of service is ideal, as it doesn't align us perfectly with our customers, but cost of service does provide shareholders with a reasonable risk-to-reward trade off.”
The Enbridge proposal has faced opposition from a number of Canadian producers including the Canadian Shippers’ Group comprised of  oilsands producers Canadian Natural Resources Limited,  MEG Energy Corp.,  Shell Canada Limited and Total E&P Canada Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc. and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC). The Saskatchewan government also has intervened in opposition.
Supporting the proposal are Cenovus Energy Inc. and Imperial Oil Limited.
The proposed new contract carriage service will enable shippers to contract for priority access on a long-term basis for up to 90 per cent of Canadian Mainline capacity of 3.25 million bbls/d (including a fully replaced Line 3) compared to the current common carrier service in which shippers can obtain capacity only on a month-to-month basis.
Enbridge will reserve a minimum of 10 per cent (325,000 bbls/d) of the available Mainline capacity for shipments of spot or uncommitted volumes which will continue to be available for nominations on a month-to-month basis.
If approved by the CER,  the new service and tolling framework would be implemented following the completion  of the Line 3 replacement project which restores the line’s capacity to 760,000 bbls/d, about 370,000 bbls/d more than today. Construction is currently underway in Minnesota and the line is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company said Tuesday. 
Enbridge is to file its reply evidence in the tolls proceeding by April 19, 2021, after which the CER will determine the next steps.

Self-Powering Pipelines Offer Investment Opportunity For Enbridge | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc. is beginning to leverage its renewable capabilities to self-power its existing North American Liquids and Gas Transmission pipelines, the company’s virtual investor day heard Tuesday.
“With technology improvements, it’s become economic for us to power our own pipelines and that gives us a whole new set of near-term potential,” said Matthew Akman, senior vice-president, Strategy and Power. 
Enbridge spends more than $1 billion a year on power for its Liquids pipelines alone and there’s a huge opportunity to replace operating costs with attractive capital projects, he said. “We will build mostly behind the meters’ solar facilities to power our pump stations and compressor stations.”
The company is replacing known operating costs with attractive capital investment opportunities, said Akman. “Returns here are solid and let’s just say the counterparty is second to none.”  
With the number of electric drive compressors on Enbridge’s gas system and pumps on its Liquid system across North America, the company sees at least $500 million in capital investments over the next few years and that should grow over time, he said.
“These aren’t just imaginative for us; we are doing this right now.”
Although some of the projects are quite small, others — especially in the Liquids Pipelines segment — can be quite large and can exceed 15 megawatts, said Akman. “These are really approaching utility-scale solar projects.”
In southern Alberta, a 10.5-megawatt solar facility is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2021 while in Heidlersburg, Pennsylvania, a three-megawatt solar facility currently under construction has a projected in-service date early in 2021.
“The key thing to note on the self-power projects is we look at them like any other capital project within Enbridge,” he said. “They go through our rigorous investment review process and they compete with other power projects, and also with other projects in the other business units.”
 In terms of the execution, “we're good at this stuff and we're just getting better at it,” said Akman. “And we think, we are an industry leader actually in this and have been doing it for a long time, so we think the execution risk is relatively low.”

"Future Value Of Trans Mountain Pipeline Rests On Liberals' Climate Plans, PBO Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(The Canadian Press) –– The federal government could end up losing money on the Trans Mountain pipeline if it further tightens its climate policy and ends up decreasing demand for Canadian oil, the parliamentary budget officer says.
The federal government bought the pipeline, and the unfinished work to increase its capacity by twinning it, in August 2018 for $4.4 billion.
The Liberals haven't been able to find a buyer for the pipeline from Alberta to the West Coast. They are instead paying for its expansion, which the most recent estimate says will cost $12.6 billion.
The increased capacity wouldn't come online until the end of 2022.
The budget officer said the pipeline remains profitable based on expected cash flows, estimating the government could make $600 million above its purchase price.
But Yves Giroux warned in his report Tuesday that everything could change based on circumstances both beyond and within the government's control, including changes to climate policy that would reduce demand for the petroleum products the pipeline moves.
Giroux also provided a scenario for the Liberals' promise to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, estimating that doing so could lead to a $1.5-billion loss on Trans Mountain by turning off the taps in the same year.
And that estimate led environmental groups to argue the government should spend less on the pipeline and more on tackling climate change.
The report Tuesday was an update on the PBO's report from early 2019 that pegged the cost of the pipeline and planned expansion project at between $3.6 billion and $4.6 billion, meaning the government might have overpaid for the project two years ago.
The Liberals have argued the costs were worth it to save a project that looked doomed when Kinder Morgan Canada Limited and its investors got cold feet in the face of legal opposition and political uncertainty.
“TMX is a good project that has created more than 7,000 jobs for Canadians,'' Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan told the House of Commons Tuesday.
“There is a very strong business case for the project and construction will continue.''
Despite a series of legal wins for the pipeline's construction, and government money going into it, a sale hasn't happened.
It's unlikely the Liberals will ever find a buyer because the PBO report adds to arguments that Trans Mountain isn't economically viable, said NDP finance critic Peter Julian.
He called on the Liberals to shift spending from the pipeline to climate change projects like green energy infrastructure.
“It was a mistake for Mr. Trudeau in 24 hours to come up with [$4.4 billion] and throw that at the company,'' he said during a virtual press conference.
“It would be a bigger mistake to keep pouring money –– taxpayers' money –– into this project, even though it is almost in all the scenarios that are realistic, it is going to be a money-loser.''
Giroux's report last year estimated the government would lose upwards of $2.5 billion if the expansion didn't go ahead.
In his report Tuesday, Giroux estimated that a one-year delay in getting the expansion online would translate into a $400 million loss. A 10 per cent drop in construction costs would put the profit margin at $1 billion, or $200 million if costs rise.
In a statement, Giroux said the precocity of the outlook lay with federal policy.
""The profitability of the assets is highly contingent on the climate policy stance of the federal government and on the future utilization rate of the pipeline,'' he said.

Line 3 Replacement Expected In Q4 Of 2021 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
With construction on its Line 3 replacement project finally underway in Minnesota, Enbridge Inc. now expects the line to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company said today.
Project costs also have risen with incremental financing required for the project as a result of regulatory and legal delays over the past two years, Vern Yu, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines, told a company investor day this morning.
Winter construction of the 300-mile (500 kilometre) line and building in a COVID-19 environment also are expected to add to the costs and due to the timing, there will be environmental restrictions on when it can build, he said.
And while Enbridge hopes it can achieve an earlier in-service date, said Yu, the priority will be on building the line safely and in an environmentally conscious manner, noted Al Monaco, president and chief executive officer.
Enbridge will provide a revised cost estimate early next year.
In 2017, with the project expected to be in-service in the second half of 2019, Enbridge revised the estimated final cost of the project cost to C$5.3 billion for the Canadian segment and US$2.9 billion for the United States section. The cost was up nine per cent from 2014 sanctioned costs.
Shippers will pay a surcharge of US89 cents/bbl on every bbl shipped for 15 years on the line, which will restore the capacity of the line to 760,000 bbls/d, adding another 370,000 bbls/d, similar to its initial capacity.  
The Canadian segment of Line 3 went into service a year ago, helping to ease pipeline constraints for Canadian shippers.

TC Energy Establishes At-The-Market Equity Program | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation has established an at-the-market equity program (ATM program).
This allows the company to issue common shares from treasury having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1 billion, or its U.S. dollar equivalent, to the public from time to time, at the company’s discretion, at the prevailing market price when sold through the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or any other applicable existing trading market for the common shares in Canada or the United States.
The formal establishment of the ATM program, which is effective for a 25-month period, is consistent with the intent to do so announced by the company in conjunction with its decision to proceed with Keystone XL in March 2020. While not a component of the company’s base funding plan, it provides additional financial flexibility in support of TC Energy’s consolidated credit metrics and capital program, including the Keystone XL pipeline project, and may be activated if and as deemed appropriate.
The company entered into an equity distribution agreement dated Dec. 7, 2020 (Equity Distribution Agreement) with TD Securities Inc., TD Securities (USA) LLC, BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., Barclays Capital Canada Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., Scotia Capital Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc.

KXL Is ‘Absolute Priority’ For Canadian Government Following Recent U.S. Election: O’Regan | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
With the recent presidential election results in the United States — for the most part — now determined, there is “renewed concern” over the future of Keystone XL, says Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan. However, he assures the local business community that Canada’s federal government continues to promote and support the project.
“I want to send a clear message to every worker, every family, and every business relying on this project: Keystone is an absolute priority for this government,” he told an Edmonton and Calgary Chambers of Commerce online event.
U.S. president-elect Joe Biden has stated previously that if elected he would rescind the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made sure to discuss KXL with Biden during their first telephone call after Americans went to the polls last month, according to the O’Regan.
“That is the definition of a priority. I understand the worry, and I understand this is coming at a time when the energy sector does not want or need any more worries.”
Fortunately, for project proponents, Biden and his staff seem to be pragmatic, O’Regan said, and there are many Biden supporters who are strong on the union front, which bodes well for the KXL project. He added that TC Energy Corporation has “wisely shored up a lot of good union contracts” in the U.S., which could be key for Keystone.
“They’ve done a tremendous job, I think, in updating the KXL proposal so that operationally it will be net-zero, and it will have strong Indigenous participation and involvement on both sides of the border.”
On the part of governments, maintaining a “united front” is important to promoting Canada’s energy interests, with provinces and the feds aligning on issues of mutual concern, such as KXL, suggested O’Regan. “That’s very potent to the outside world, and it’s very potent to industry as well, when they know that governments are working together.
“We may not always agree, but I think on the big, important stuff, we have to agree. As far as I’m concerned, getting access for our energy is of the highest national priority.”
ESG important to Canadian energy
One of the strongest arguments his government can make for Keystone XL to the incoming Biden administration in the U.S. is Canada’s record on tackling climate change and working to make the oil and gas sector far more sustainable, O’Regan told the chamber event. He noted investors are “making some clear choices” throughout the resource sector.
“They’re putting their money into industries, and into jurisdictions that are taking action on climate change, and divesting from sectors that in their view are not taking action,” he said, adding that Canada is already recognized as a world leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. “You guys, Canadian industry, understands the direction markets are moving, and you’re following the money.
“You’re already taking action to make sure that our natural resource sectors are more sustainable than ever. The Canadian petroleum sector is by far our country’s largest investor in the cleantech sector. It accounts for more than 70 per cent of all private-sector investment in R&D. That’s more than $1 billion every year.”
For its part, the federal government is investing significantly to reduce carbon and methane emissions, leveraging energy assets to expand into new opportunities such as hydrogen, carbon capture, and renewable natural gas, the minister noted. Coupled with an ambitious climate plan, he said, Canada has a strong case to make for the support of the U.S. president-elect towards the Keystone XL pipeline project.
“On all estimates, Canadian oil and gas is going to continue to be a major part of our energy mix for decades to come, if we keep improving the quality, if we keep lowering emissions, and if we keep driving its competitiveness. That’s what we need to keep our eye on.”
The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), for one, through its Cleantech Practice has invested nearly $350 million, supporting more than 30 cleantech firms. The BDC launched Cleantech Practice after the 2017 federal budget allocated to the bank $600 million in capital to support clean-technology firms in Canada.
Energy sector good for Newfoundland and Labrador
As the Member of Parliament for St. John’s South — Mount Pearl, O’Regan told last week’s chambers event he is “reminded every day” just how important the energy sector is not only to Alberta and the national economy, but to his home province as well. “I’m speaking to you from St. John’s, and I can look out at the harbour here and see the supply ships coming in after servicing oil rigs some 350 kilometres off our shore.”
To support Canada’s offshore sector, last week it was announced, on behalf of West White Rose partners, Husky Energy Inc. will receive $41.5 million (half of the total project costs) in federal money to maintain near-term jobs and protect the option of re-starting the project in 2022, if conditions permit.
“We are proud of our offshore, and proud of the people who built it,” O’Regan said during that announcement. “We’ll continue to support workers and invest in their future.”
In September, the federal government announced $320 million to be administered by Newfoundland and Labrador to support direct and indirect employment in the province’s oil and gas sector and activities that generate environmental and co-benefits. This West White Rose project provides employment for 169 people, including for project management and engineering, in-province, as well as 162 tradespersons in Argentia and Marystown for a total of 331 people.

National Energy Security Matters To Canada; Clean Fuel Standard Key For Industry: O’Regan | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
There is “renewed focus” on national energy security, says Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan, and Canadian leadership consistently highlights the importance of continental energy security with those in power south of the border — be it with the outgoing Donald Trump presidential administration or the incoming Joe Biden one.
“I think the pandemic, and dealing sometimes with the precariousness of other governments, has caused us to look at energy security as a very real thing,” he told Friday’s Edmonton and Calgary Chambers of Commerce online event. “When we start talking about developing the refining capacity within the country, I know there are other ministers who have attempted to tackle this, and obviously these are very much private sector investment-led major projects.”
As for how Canada is going to gain improved access to markets for its hydrocarbon resources, O’Regan noted the Trans Mountain expansion project, which he said is under construction, creating jobs in the process. Key to the success of that project is the Indigenous engagement that led to its viability in the courts, he added.
“We did it right, and we did it meaningfully,” O’Regan told the chambers event. “What that basically means is you have to go in with the spirit of accommodation.”
According to O’Regan, the federal government’s attempts with Bill C-69 is to encapsulate something that has been before the courts constantly, which is Indigenous opposition to natural resource developments. The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) aims to bring needed accommodation into the process so such projects can avoid the courts, and the added instability and investor uncertainty such court involvement implies.
“If you have a clear process that involves the meaningful consultation on the front end, and if you do it right, which we’ve proven with TMX, court tested, then you can get good projects built. But you must accept the fact First Nations, Inuit and Métis have a rightful claim and involvement in these projects.”
When the political risks perhaps became too difficult for the private sector to move forward on the TMX project, he noted, the federal government stepped in. However, it does not intend on being the long-term owner of the project.
O’Regan said: “We have launched an engagement process right now with Indigenous groups that we believe could benefit from TMX. We are committed to that, and we think that Indigenous communities have an opportunity for some very meaningful participation in TMX.”
Clean Fuel Standard
In 2022, Canada’s Clean Fuel Standard (CFS) comes into force, representing a major piece of the federal climate policy framework, aiming to help Canada drop GHG emissions by 30-per-cent before 2030. Although a final draft is yet to be released, the regulation will apply to all fossil fuels sold in Canada.
During Friday’s chambers event, O’Regan said the CFS is not just the right thing to do, but it is competitively necessary, and will help “make the case” for Keystone XL south of the border.
“It’ll help diversify our economy, it’ll attract investment in new low-carbon technologies, it’ll reduce emissions, and it’ll create well-paying jobs right across all sectors of the economy, including industry, transportation, cleantech and agriculture. Using cleaner fuels in our buildings, vehicles and industry is one of the best ways to reduce emissions.”
However, a new Canada West Foundation (CWF) report suggests emissions-intensive and trade-exposed sectors face unique challenges with the proposed CFS, and without sufficient protections in place, the government actually risks damaging competitiveness by burdening these industries with duplicated costs.
For the sake of these industries and the related jobs, the report recommends the federal government acknowledge and address how the CFS may impact these industries and take steps to mitigate those risks accordingly.
According to O’Regan, his government will work with the Alberta and Saskatchewan governments to ensure the CFS comes in as seamless and easy as possible. He stresses that the CFS helps enable Canada to sell energy projects (such as Keystone XL) to the incoming Biden administration. “That is a big national priority.”
Hydrogen future
When will Canada have a national hydrogen strategy? “Extremely soon,” is how O’Regan would characterize the answer. While hydrogen fuel has been around for several years and has a bit of a “right-around-the-corner” reputation in terms of its eventual large-scale uptake, O’Regan told last week’s chambers event that the market has significantly changed in more recent years to make its advancement and adoption quite feasible for Canada.
He said: “We think hydrogen has tremendous potential, and particularly tremendous potential for Alberta. We have the expertise in batteries. We have the expertise in transportation. We have the energy workers. We think there is huge export potential to produce hydrogen using carbon capture.”
Ultimately, he believes, success in the Canadian hydrogen space will see millions of vehicles fueled by hydrogen, which is particularly beneficial in terms of semi-trailer trucks. “If you could get them onto hydrogen, then that would be great. Also, in steel, in domestic heating, this is becoming an increasingly global competitive industry.”
The European Union is investing billions of euros into developing hydrogen energy, noted O’Regan, and this could make the political and economic union not only a competitor, but potentially a good customer for Canada. “We have some clear advantages. We have leadership and innovation with our companies.”
He added: “The other advantage we have is that we have rich feedstocks. We have a clean electricity grid. We have all the resources. We have nuclear. We have biomass resources. We have a baseline that can help here.”
Further, O’Regan said, Burnaby-based Ballard Power Systems Inc. is one of the world’s top fuel-cell technology firms. Canada also has good proximity to global markets. “We have deepwater ports, and we have all our free trade agreements in place. I think we’re moving quite nicely on hydrogen.”

Westcoast 2021 Interim Tolls Approved By CER | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has approved as filed Westcoast Energy Inc.’s proposed 2021 interim transmission tolls for Zones 3 and 4 for services on the Westcoast system, effective Jan.1, 2021.
The commission found the 2021 tolls to have been calculated in accordance with the 2020 and 2021 transmission toll settlement.
Westcoast indicated that shippers were given notice of the proposed interim tolls and that the company’s Toll and Tariff Task Force (TTFP) members voted unanimously in support of the proposed interim tolls.
The commission noted that a decision regarding interim tolls is, in no way, a ruling as to the merits of any application that may come before it regarding the setting of final tolls.

"Canadian Indigenous Deal With Keystone XL Pipeline Took Years, Aims To Unlock Long-Term Wealth | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) – TC Energy Corporation’s sale of a C$1 billion (US$769 million) stake in Keystone XL to a Canadian Indigenous group is the result of over three years of pressure from a tiny Saskatchewan First Nation that demanded part ownership of the long-delayed oil pipeline, rather than short-term payments for allowing it to be built through its lands.
Natural Law Energy's (NLE) planned investment was billed by TC Energy as the biggest-ever Indigenousinvestment in an oil project, highlighting how some communities are seeking to share in the industry's profits while others oppose it.
Adding indigenous support may help efforts by Canada and TC Energy to convince U.S. president-elect Joe Biden not to revoke the permit of the $8-billion Keystone XL when he takes office as he has promised.
If they are successful, millions of dollars will flow over a generation into indigenous communities to help youth afford university or pay for business investments, said Chief Alvin Francis of Nekaneet First Nation in Saskatchewan, one of five involved in NLE.
""It's about making life better for all of our youth,"" Francis said.
""If I could meet Joe Biden I’d say, 'This a chance for you to change my First Nation's view of the world.'""
TC proposed Keystone XL 12 years ago and the project has since run into a steady series of legal and political obstacles, opposed by some U.S. tribes, landowners and environmental activists.
Nekaneet, a community of about 540 people, has never been involved in a deal of this scale, having previously developed a strip mall.
It joined four First Nations – Ermineskin, Akamihk, Louis Bull Tribe and Little Pine – to form NLE. The coalition has attracted interest from banks in financing TC's project, given that much of its shipping capacity is already under contract, said NLE director Brian Mountain. He declined to identify the banks.
""What we're doing is creating intergenerational wealth,"" Mountain said.
NLE is talking with Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation, a provincial corporation, about guaranteeing some of the loans, he said.
Spokespeople for Canada's six big banks declined to comment or did not respond. There is precedent for banks supporting indigenous investments in energy, such as a C$545 million bond issue for two bands in 2017 to invest in a Suncor Energy Inc. storage facility.
Financing is set to close in the third quarter next year, likely well after Biden clarifies his position on Keystone XL, easing risk for the First Nations, said Ken Coates, a professor of public policy at University of Saskatchewan.
Francis said while there is risk Biden will quash Keystone XL, he is optimistic his position will soften.
Long-term deal
He said he asked TC in 2017 for a benefits-sharing agreement that would last Keystone XL's lifetime. TC balked, but in late 2019 it contacted Francis and asked if Nekaneet would buy a stake.
That began a year of negotiations and development of the coalition.
Under the deal, TC would give NLE a stake and pay it a prescribed annual return in exchange for NLE raising funds and investing them in Keystone XL, Mountain said.
NLE would use the proceeds to repay loans for its investment and provide cash to its First Nations for 30 years.
The payments will be based on Keystone XL’s revenues. Mountain and TC declined to estimate the payments' value and TC did not confirm NLE's account of the deal's structure, saying it was confidential.
For TC, the investment allows the company to tie up less of its own capital, after recently selling a stake in its Coastal GasLink pipeline to private equity.
The partnership reflects TC's commitment to sharing Keystone’s benefits with Indigenous communities in both Canada and the United States, company spokesman Terry Cunha said.

Nord Stream 2 Pipeline Construction To Restart Despite Sanctions | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Bloomberg) — Construction work on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea will resume this week, despite U.S. sanctions designed to end the pipeline that will bring Russian gas to Germany.
Pipelaying on the 9.5 billion-euro (US$11.2 billion) link will restart Dec. 5 after being halted for a year because of the sanctions, Nord Stream 2 company spokesman Jens Mueller said by email. Work on the 1,230-kilometre (764-mile) pipeline stopped last December when the Trump administration added measures against companies working on the link.
German companies and Chancellor Angela Merkel are bridling against America’s interference, and the Western companies set to reap rewards once gas starts flowing have vowed to move ahead. U.S. President Donald Trump has opposed the project, which he says will increase European dependence on Russian energy supplies.
So far, none of Nord Stream 2’s financial backers have pulled out despite escalating anger from the U.S. OMV along with Royal Dutch Shell plc, Uniper SE, Engie SA and Wintershall AG helped finance the project.

Minnesota Tribes File To Halt Pipeline Approval Due To Virus | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — Two Native American tribes in northern Minnesota are asking state regulators to stop the imminent construction of Enbridge Inc.'s Line 3 crude oil pipeline replacement, saying it would increase the risk of coronavirus infections spreading.
The Red Lake and White Earth Bands of Chippewa filed a motion late Wednesday asking the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to stay its approval of the $2.6 billion project. They argue construction would put locals at increased risk of coronavirus infections as workers move into the area.
The bands and other pipeline opponents have sued and protested to try to block the project, and an appeal by the state Commerce Department is pending. They want the PUC to halt the project while that legal challenge plays out.
The pipeline project took a step forward on Monday when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the final federal permit needed. The Public Utilities Commission has already approved the project several times, but still needs to give construction a final green light.
Enbridge says the pipeline replacement will provide a safer way to transport the oil to Midwest refineries while creating 4,200 construction jobs and generating millions of dollars in local spending and tax revenues.

Keystone XL’s Indigenous Investors Plan To Secure Financing Soon | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Bloomberg) — The Indigenous group seeking to buy a stake in TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL oil pipeline expects to secure financing by the first quarter of next year.
Natural Law Energy, which represents five Indigenous communities in Alberta and Saskatchewan, is confident the funding will allow it to acquire as much as 12 per cent of the project, according to chief executive officer Travis Meguinis.
 “We have a number of investment funds at the table,” Meguinis said in a phone interview.
Efforts to revive the pipeline project to ship oilsands crude into the U.S. are facing a crucial moment with the victory of president-elect Joe Biden. The proposed conduit, which was rejected by the Obama administration and reinstated by the Trump government, requires backing from the executive branch to cross the border.
Natural Law Energy will make an equity investment of as much as C$1 billion in the project, Calgary-based TC Energy said earlier this month. Investment by Indigenous groups, which often spearhead opposition to pipelines, could help persuade Biden to allow the project to go forward even after his campaign pledged to rescind the permit granted by outgoing President Donald Trump.
Meguinis said he is optimistic about the project regardless of the change in U.S. administrations after TC Energy signed agreements to have the pipeline built by pro-Democratic labour unions in the U.S. In its first eight years, the project will generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Natural Law’s participating first nations, growing to hundreds of millions of dollars thereafter, he said.

Other stories in our recent heavy oil series:
Opportunities Exist For Canadian Heavy Crude To Make Up For Shortfalls In The U.S. Gulf Coast
Crude-By-Rail Volumes Inching Up But Not Expected To Surge Going Forward
Promising Outlook For Western Canadian Condensate

Heavy crude oil production in Western Canada is currently in something of a state of limbo.
After producers were forced to reduce heavy oil output by around 550,000 bbls/d in the spring in response to the short-lived oil price crash and refinery demand pullback, supplies have since recovered by about 350,000 bbls/d based on data from the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). To this point, producers are now left sitting on their collective hands, unwilling to take production much higher for fear of inventories building too rapidly and generating price discounts that might widen in the face of stagnant refinery demand.
This is effectively what RBN argued in Part 1 of this series in that there was little reason for more heavy oil supplies to come to market until the middle of next year. With the added nuance of the Alberta government about to lift its oil supply limits on December 1, but carefully watching price discounts and inventory conditions that might force it to again re-impose supply limits, another rapid increase in supplies is not the kind of attention that heavy oil producers want or need.
Effectively, this means that heavy oil supplies are expected to go roughly sideways for at least another six months and then rise more steadily into mid-2021 as producers meet refiners’ increased demand for Canadian heavy crude. So what might this tell us about pipeline utilization and rail shipments and, ultimately, about the direction for heavy oil price differentials?
The most revealing data on the degree of utilization of oil pipelines comes from the Enbridge Mainline. We focus on this pipeline as it operates under a month-to-month shipping schedule meaning that producers need not pay any tolls for a month in which they do not ship crude. This boils down to the Enbridge Mainline representing the incremental need and cost for shipping oil bbls to market, unlike other pipelines which operate under long term take-or-pay tolling agreements.
Publicly available data to September for the Mainline reveals that total crude oil throughput has been running between 2.4 and 2.6 million bbls/d since the supply pullback of April, with total capacity utilizations in the range of 80 per cent to 90 per cent. Although this may seem high, total crude oil throughput volumes were in the 2.8 million bbls/d range with utilizations closer to 100 per cent prior to the supply pullback. With heavy oil production having recovered only a portion of the pullback from earlier in the year, and not expected to go much higher, RBN feels that Mainline throughput volumes will hold near 2.6 million bbls/d until the second quarter of 2021, with utilization steady in the 80 per cent to 90 per cent range. This is also consistent with the low end of the guidance range for the Mainline that Enbridge provided in its most recent quarterly results update.

But there is more to the story — one can also consider apportionment on the Mainline for those volumes that are strictly heavy oil. Doing so reveals which parts of the pipeline are being utilized for heavy oil transportation and how intensely. After the supply pullback, the degree of heavy oil apportionment fell to zero between May and August of this year, the first such period of zero apportionment in five years. For September and October, it has risen into the range of 12 per cent to 18 per cent, respectively, while current estimates for November and December are at 22 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.
Heavy oil apportionment in the range of 20 per cent or so for the Mainline is typically not suggestive of overly tight pipeline capacity, but does suggest that capacity is close to running full. This would also be consistent with RBN’s view that producers have pushed about as much supply as they can, without completely exhausting all available pipeline capacity which would typically act as a precursor to wider price differentials. If we consider how the WCS Hardisty-WTI price discount has behaved over the course of 2020 to date, then the most recent apportionment figures and the most recent forward curve for the price differentials suggest that throughput volumes and apportionment values are consistent with a pipeline that is relatively full, but not so full as to cause recent or near-term price differentials to widen considerably — which would be more reflective of a pipeline or pipelines which are completely full and unable to take more bbls.

It has also been the case over the course of 2020, that the near month forward price differential has typically tightened (i.e. smaller price discount) as the nearest month for physical shipments came into focus. As such, RBN’s view is that once December heavy oil shipments begin to take place with supplies holding relatively flat, the price differential will modestly tighten and that final apportionment figures for December, for instance, will end up being lower than the current estimated 30 per cent.
The point here is that available pipeline capacity is not likely to show signs of significant shortage, and thus, no pressing need for the price discount to deepen until later in 2021 when supplies ramp up to meet improved refinery demand. The opposite side of this coin is that a narrower price discount will not incentivize much railing of crude, simply because the bbls that are being supplied can reach their designated market, for the most part, by pipeline.
Since the spring, the railing of Canadian crude oil has undergone its most significant collapse on record this year. The heavy oil supply pullback meant a reduction in crude by rail (CBR) exports from record volumes over 400,000 bbls/d in February to just 50,000 bbls/d as of August. More recent weekly rail shipment data appears to suggest crude by rail exports in the range of 100,000 bbls/d, but this may reflect some specific marketing arrangements between producers and end use refiners rather than purely driven by recent WCS price discounts.

What is most noteworthy with the railing data is that volumes were very high when the price discount for WCS was in the range of US$15 to US$20/bbl, and above the notional cost threshold of shipping bbls to the U.S. Midwest or Gulf Coast which is in the range of $14 to $16/bbl, depending on the specific marketing arrangements. If the current forward curve for the price differential is to be believed, then this shipping cost threshold is not met until later in 2021. This would also fit with the time period in which RBN believes supplies will increase to meet higher refining demand and the need for more crude to move by rail. Crude oil shipments by rail will improve during 2021, but are unlikely to reach the previous record highs seen in early 2020. What will be of more interest is to where those crude oil bbls will be railed in 2021 and perhaps well into 2022, depending on the pace at which pipeline expansions are completed.
We mentioned in Part 1 of this series that 98 per cent of Canada’s heavy oil exports end up in U.S. PADDs 2, 3 and 4. What is of particular interest from the standpoint of future crude by rail shipments is that when supplies do start to ramp up later in 2021, it is RBN’s view that nearly all of the incremental heavy oil shipped by rail will be moving to the U.S. Gulf Coast (PADD 3). With refiners in PADDs 2 and 4 already saturated with Canadian bbls, then any additional supplies by rail will have to go to the Gulf Coast. As pipeline access from Canada to the Gulf Coast is more limited than it is for bbls that flow to PADDs 2 or 4, this means that if you want to get lots more Canadian heavy oil to the Gulf, railing is going to be a more viable option.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on total imports of Canadian crude oil and imports by rail into the Gulf Coast show that not only has the volume of imports been on a mostly rising trend, but that the vast majority of railed crude exports from Canada have been destined for the Gulf. As refinery activity along the Gulf Coast rebounds from the hurricane and tropical storm impacts earlier this year, in addition to potentially structurally improved demand in 2021, Canadian heavy oil bbls should be arriving by rail in greater force.

Canada would be exporting those heavy oil bbls into a market which remains hungry for such material. It is already well known that refiners in the Gulf Coast are well equipped to run more medium and heavy sour crude. The goal for Gulf Coast refiners for many years was to run with relatively cheap Mexican and Venezuelan heavy oil bbls. With Mexican heavy oil production in decline for many years and plans by Pemex to keep more of those bbls in-country for its own consumption in the future, this imported supply of heavy oil into the U.S. is likely to be further constricted in the years ahead or remain flat at best. Imports of Venezuelan heavy oil have also been declining given the chaos gripping that country in recent years and U.S. sanctions on the import of Venezuelan crude oil have driven these imports to zero since mid-2019. For a U.S. Gulf Coast refiner wanting assured supplies of heavy oil bbls in the future, Canadian heavy oil is looking very attractive and logistically reasonable to import by rail.

So what does all of this actually mean for the heavy oil price differential? As we discussed in Part 1 of this analysis, Canadian heavy oil production is unlikely to move higher from current levels of 1.8 million bbls/d until at least spring 2021. The reasons for this are that U.S. refiners will have little need for additional Canadian heavy oil bbls until then and producers should remain wary of an overly rapid refill of Alberta oil storage prior to the increase in refinery demand. These two factors should prevent an immediate widening of the heavy oil price discount from near its current range of US$10/bbl.
On the transportation side of the business, with supplies expected to be roughly flat, pipelines are unlikely to see an increase in utilization until next year. Until such time as the pipelines are unable to handle any additional supplies, there will be little need for additional crude oil to move by rail. This also supports RBN’s view that the heavy oil price differential will hold near its current range.
Once U.S. refinery demand does start to recovery more forcefully in the spring of next year, heavy oil supplies will be increasing, pipelines will be fully utilized, and additional bbls will be exported by rail. To accommodate the increase in railing, RBN expects that the price discount for WCS to WTI will widen modestly into the US$14 to US$16/bbl range in the second half of 2021. That level should be sufficient to cover the notional cost of transporting bbls by rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the market where Canadian heavy oil bbls will be in greatest incremental demand.

For the long term, RBN has developed a scenario in which the WCS price discount remains below US$16/bbl indefinitely. That scenario is predicated on greater availability of export pipelines from Canada such as the Enbridge Line 3 expansion (expected early 2022) and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX) by late 2022. Given the lower cost of shipping crude by pipeline and the optionality of exporting heavy crude oil from Canada’s West Coast upon the completion of TMX, these additional pipeline developments should maintain a strong bid for Canadian heavy oil in relation to the Gulf Coast. It is also conceivable that significant blowouts in the price differential as were seen in late 2018, barring some lengthy pipeline infrastructure impediments, may become a relic of the past under the conditions of greatly expanded pipeline access and strong demand for heavy oil by rail into the Gulf Coast.
With increasing interest being expressed in Canadian heavy oil by overseas buyers such as India’s Reliance and Spain’s Repsol, ostensibly to offset their risks in accessing either Mexican or Venezuelan heavy oil, re-exports through the Gulf Coast look to be an added benefit. With the twin demands of Gulf Coast refiners and overseas buyers, RBN foresees shipments of Canadian heavy oil by rail into the Gulf Coast being sustained in the 150 to 200,000 bbl/d range starting in mid-2021 and for the foreseeable future. This outlook includes what is expected by mid-2021 to be 50,000 bbls/d of bitumen railed from the USD/Gibson Energy diluent recovery unit in Hardisty, Alberta.
Once the chaotic disruptions of this year to the crude oil market are more fully behind us, the outlook for Canadian heavy oil supplies and the demand for those supplies looks much brighter in 2021 and beyond. More pipeline access will be close at hand, a decreasing likelihood of very wide and volatile heavy oil pricing differentials, an improved and more sustained use of crude by rail, greater intake by Gulf Coast refiners of Canadian heavy oil, and a growing suite of buyers of heavy oil off the Canadian West Coast and U.S Gulf Coast all point to a much stronger and dynamic future for Canadian heavy oil supplies.

Biden’s Energy Policies The Focus Of New Report From Sproule | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A new report by Sproule that takes an initial look at United States’ president-elect Joe Biden’s potential energy policies says that from a Canadian perspective his administration’s handling of the Keystone XL pipeline will be front and centre in the coming months.
The report, produced in collaboration with Boost Energy Ventures and called President-Elect Biden and the Clean Energy Revolution, highlights several key initiatives underpinning Biden’s energy platform and aims to provide insight into his plans’ feasibility and potential implications.
“We tried to look at what the Biden administration has come out and said their focus is going to be in terms of energy policy,” said Liam O’Brien, Sproule’s senior associate, strategic advisory and one of the authors of the report.
In the report, the firm noted that a Biden presidency could put long-term Canadian and Williston Basin excess pipeline capacity “at risk” but that the impact of cancelling Keystone XL for Canadian producers is “likely minimal” in the near-term from an excess pipeline capacity perspective.
“From a Canadian point of view, Keystone XL has obviously been in the forefront of a lot of peoples’ minds in terms of what the impact will be of a Biden administration, especially considering he has already come out in opposition to the project,” O’Brien said,
“And vice-president elect Kamala Harris has been vocal in her opposition on both Keystone and Dakota Access.”
However, the report suggests that with Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 and TMX set to add almost one million bbls/d of new egress leaving Western Canada and limited green and brownfield oilsands projects in the hopper, Western Canadian production “should remain at or below” pipeline capacity over the near-term.
“Our report highlights that from an egress perspective, Canada is in a much more optimistic position than we were say two or three years ago in terms of actually achieving excess pipeline capacity leaving Western Canada, especially with the most recent approval of Line 3 that came a few weeks ago,” O’Brien said.
“And then with Trans Mountain, which is under construction and still on track for a late-2022 commissioning, that’s another positive.”
With the addition of the two lines and about one million bbls/d of extra takeaway capacity, combined with the “relatively flat” growth trajectory for Western Canadian output over the next five years, O’Brien said operators are currently in a “much better situation” than they were a few short years ago when there was very limited line of site on excess pipeline capacity, if any at all.
But that’s not to say that Keystone XL wouldn’t be welcomed by western Canadian producers.
“Keystone is obviously still going to be hugely beneficial to the industry in that if it does go through it presents room for growth and all the benefits that come with that,” O’Brien said.
O’Brien said that from a political perspective, with Republicans retaining their Senate majority and gaining seats in the House of Representatives, implementing “contentious campaign promises” like cancelling the Keystone XL project will prove challenging for Biden.
“Adding to this, with COVID-19 causing widespread job losses, cancelling a project that is set to provide over 8,000 union jobs is unlikely to sit well with the traditionally Democratic U.S. trade unions,” he said.
“In our view, now that Biden has secured the election victory, it’s possible he softens his stance on Keystone XL in favour of more attainable and appeasing campaign promises.”
Excess pipeline capacity for Williston Basin producers, on the other hand, hinges on the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL). Without DAPL, the report noted that producers would be forced to utilize more expensive rail options to move crude out of North Dakota to downstream demand centers.
“In a region that already sees pricing discounts due to its distance away from key refining hubs, this added transportation cost could negatively impact well economics and subsequently limit production growth potential of the basin,” the report said.
Currently, DAPL is operating near capacity while undergoing a revised environmental impact and permitting process. As of Q3 2020, Energy Transfer (owner of DAPL), announced plans to expand DAPL by up to an additional 500,000 bbls/d by the end of 2021.
At this point, according to the report, it “seems unlikely that the expansion will receive approval” and there is “uncertainty around” whether the existing DAPL system will be allowed to continue operating during and/or after the environmental review.
The report also points out that Biden has been clear that no new drilling leases will be granted on federal lands under his administration.
“One of Biden’s climate plan objectives is ‘…banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters…’. It is unclear whether this means eliminating the permitting of new leases only or if the plan also includes banning any future drilling on existing leases,” the report states.
“Regardless, it will be important to understand the magnitude of development attributable to federal lands and any related implications.”
Decarbonization is feasible; net-zero is uncertain
Sproule looked at the current cost competitiveness of renewables, and the feasibility of decarbonizing the U.S. power sector.
For example, an 80-90 per cent clean power grid by 2035 is likely to be both technically feasible with existing technologies and potentially quite cost-effective. However, according to the report, a 100 per cent net-zero grid, as proposed in Biden’s plan, will “require significant technological improvements” to meet electricity needs economically while preserving grid reliability.
Those technologies would have to include storage, CCUS, hydrogen and/or nuclear, significant grid system upgrades, and significant additional policy mechanisms.
“Nevertheless, it seems very likely that a significant amount of current U.S. natural gas demand from the power sector will be displaced towards the end of the 2020s and into the 2030s,” the report said.
Deep decarbonization of the residential and commercial segments, however, will likely also require large-scale deployment of electric heat pumps and boilers, geothermal heating and/or hydrogen-based heating, a roll-out which is not addressed explicitly in Biden’s plans.
“Furthermore, decarbonizing the industrial segment would likely require both mass electrification and conversion of coal- and gas-fired industrial heating to some clean alternative [like hydrogen],” Sproule said in its report.
“Reducing fossil fuel use in the industrial sector, which alone makes up 33 per cent of U.S. gas consumption, is therefore contingent on R&D success in alternatives like hydrogen leading to an organic, market-driven transition from fossil fuels.”

Injunction Sought To Stop Shutdown Of Enbridge Line 5 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc.  says it has gone to court seeking an injunction to stop the state of Michigan from taking any steps to prevent the operation of Line 5 by terminating the easement that allows the company to operate its pipelines below the Straits of Mackinac.
The company filed a federal complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan seeking an injunction to stop the state’s effort to have the pipeline shut down May 12, 2021.
The attempt to shut down Line 5 interferes with the comprehensive federal regulation of pipeline safety and burdens interstate and foreign commerce in clear violation of federal law and the United States constitution, says Enbridge which also moved the complaint filed by the state in Michigan state court to the Federal Court.
The state's attempt to assume the role of safety regulator through its notice purporting to ""terminate and revoke"" the easement is improper and unlawful, said Enbridge.
A federal agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is its safety regulator, not the state of Michigan, it said. Only three months ago, PHMSA reviewed the safety of the dual pipelines and found them to be fit for service, according to Enbridge.
The company said it continues to live up to all its obligations under its agreements with the state of Michigan. It has undertaken a variety of Line 5 projects requested by the state at substantial expense, including installing a new Line 5 crossing under the St. Clair River earlier this year and diligently pursuing permitting for the Great Lakes tunnel project at no cost to taxpayers.
""In the face of continued roadblocks by this administration it's time for the state to stop playing politics with the energy needs and anxieties of U.S. and Canadian consumers and businesses that depend on Line 5,"" Vern Yu, executive vice-president and president, Liquids Pipelines, said.
""We remain highly committed to protecting the Great Lakes, the environment, and all the people who use these waters while delivering energy that people rely on daily,” he said. “Enbridge's Line 5 has served Michiganders safely without spilling a drop of oil at the Straits crossing for more than 65 years, over nine different state administrations.""
A disruption of Line 5 would create a propane shortage, higher energy prices and hardship for Michigan families, especially those on fixed incomes or of modest means, according to Yu. It would also result in a daily shortage of more than14 million gallons of gasoline and other transportation fuels, affecting the entire region, including Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Quebec.
A Line 5 disruption would significantly and adversely affect 10 regional refineries, said Enbridge. Some of the refineries served by the line also supply a large percentage of the aviation fuel at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport.
Separately on Tuesday, Enbridge announced that the Line 3 replacement project has received approval to begin construction. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission issued their authorization to construct. The one remaining permit is a storm water permit which is provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

"Canada Welcomes Choice Of Kerry As U.S. Climate Czar, Will Defend Pipeline: Envoy | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) – Canada welcomes the choice of John Kerry as new U.S. climate envoy but will press Washington not to cancel permits for an oil pipeline he opposes, Ottawa’s ambassador to the United States said on Tuesday.
“We see a huge number of opportunities to work with the Americans on the international stage and also bilaterally on the fight against climate change. So this is good news,"" Kirsten Hillman told an event organized by the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations.
President-elect Joe Biden this week announced Kerry would be his climate czar, a cabinet-level position. Kerry played an important role in crafting the Paris Agreement on climate but President Donald Trump has withdrawn from the treaty.
Biden has promised to rejoin the climate accord, a move Hillman said was ""really excellent.""
But Biden's focus on the need to do more to curb emissions of greenhouse gases could have big implications for Canada, a major fossil fuel exporter that has never met any of its climate change targets.
One immediate challenge for Canada is Biden's vow to scrap U.S. permits for TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone crude pipeline, a project that would move oil from Alberta to Nebraska.
As secretary of state in 2015, Kerry blocked the project on the grounds it would undermine the fight against climate change, a decision reversed by Trump in 2017.
""Times have changed. The project is not the same project. The company itself ... has made enormous innovations,"" Hillman later told reporters, noting Canada had imposed a price on carbon and committed to net-zero emissions by 2050.
“There is a place for fossil fuels in an economy that is seeking to have an energy transition,"" she said. "" ... it is better (for the United States) to get it from us than all the other alternatives.""

Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Project Receives Federal Permits | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved federal permits for Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 project, including the Section 404, Section 10 and Section 408 permits.
""We have now received all federal permits required for replacing Line 3, an essential maintenance project that will better protect Minnesota communities and the environment,"" said Leo Golden vice-president of Line 3 execution.  ""These permits reflect yet another science-based approval for the project, which now moves closer to the start of construction, hopefully before the end of the year. Final state permits and authorizations are still needed before work can begin.""
One key permitting input was the Tribal Cultural Resource Survey of the entire route of Line 3 which was managed by the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.  The survey was the longest and most extensive of its kind for an energy project, said Enbridge.
“The replacement of Line 3 is a safety and maintenance focused private investment in Minnesota's energy infrastructure. It is the best option for protecting the environment and communities while meeting the region's energy needs,” Enbridge stated.
The project is poised to provide significant economic benefits for counties, small businesses, Native American communities, and union members, bringing 4,200 family-sustaining, mostly local construction jobs, millions of dollars in local spending and additional tax revenues at a time when Northern Minnesota needs it most.

Pipe Dreams Leave U.S. Energy Firms Caught In Climate Trap | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– In remote northern Michigan a propane shortage in early 2014 caused prices to nearly double, squeezing about half of the families there who rely on the fossil fuel to heat their homes.
Glenda Bowler remembers her son fitting a wood stove at his restaurant as an alternative to propane, which reaches Michigan's Upper Peninsula via a 1038-kilometre pipeline.
""Everybody's thermostats got turned down, and you turned to supplemental, like wood or electric to help. I'm old, so I can't go cut wood,"" the 68-year-old said.
Now the future of the Enbridge Inc. owned line supplying the region is under threat, as climate activists widen their campaign to cut U.S. fossil fuel dependency from new pipelines to the refurbishment or expansion of older ones.
As authorities worldwide face the challenge of a smooth transition to a lower-carbon future, energy firms are wrestling with investment decisions to keep their businesses running and prevent supply disruptions.
Enbridge had to temporarily close its Line 5 this summer after damage was discovered, boosting calls for the 67-year-old line carrying crude oil, propane and liquid fuels to Canada through the sensitive Straits of Mackinac, to be shut down.
Nearly half the oil and gas pipeline miles that crisscross the United States are at least 50 years old. And even though the world's largest fuel consumer is starting to rely more on renewables, fossil fuels still provide almost all of its road fuel and natural gas accounts for about 40 per cent of electricity generation.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer this month revoked a decades-old easement allowing the Enbridge line to operate, saying that its location and age means it poses a major risk and vowing to shut it after a transition period.
Roughly 43 per cent of pipeline miles for hazardous liquids, which includes crude oil, were installed pre-1970, while 55 per cent of gas transmission pipeline miles were installed before 1970, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Blocking pipelines
Climate activists, Native tribes, and local opponents have waged years-long battles to prevent construction of pipelines with some, like Keystone XL, a 830,000-bbl/d crude expansion project, still in limbo after more than a decade.
Although the $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, once the largest gas line under construction, was canceled this year, the Dakota Access LLC oil pipe and other large crude pipelines from Texas have been completed in recent years.
If existing pipelines are shut, suppliers could be forced to transport fuel and gas to consumers by rail or road.
Pipelines moved 4.4 billion bbls of foreign and domestic crude oil to refineries in 2019, while rail cars accounted for just 123.6 million bbls, or three per cent of pipeline volumes, and trucking was about 2.4 per cent of pipeline volume, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed.
In Michigan, Sean McBrearty, a co-ordinator for Oil and Water Don't Mix, said the Enbridge pipeline is not needed to supply the region and that train cars or truckloads could replace it.
But analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. estimate it would take 30 trucks and half a unit train each day to haul the 40,000 bbls/d of propane that Line 5 usually supplies.
And Jim Mankervis, supervisor in Ishpeming Township, a 3,500-person community on the Upper Peninsula, doubts this is viable.
“I don't know that they could even get enough trucks to supply the [Upper Peninsula] with propane,"" he said.
Switching Upper Peninsula customers to an alternative fuel source, like natural gas, would be far from simple.
Separate lines are required from those that carry liquid fuels like propane, so a new right-of-way would be needed.
End users like homes and businesses would need to switch their own tankage and private pipes to the new fuel, at a greater cost than paying more for propane that is trucked in.
One solution agreed by Michigan’s former governor with Enbridge was to encase the existing pipeline to prevent the line from polluting the water supply.
Enbridge estimates the project, due to be completed in 2024, will cost $500 million, said Ryan Duffy, Enbridge spokesman.
""More people see it is a common sense solution to protect the environment and make what has been a safe pipeline even safer, and then also continue to make sure that energy is delivered to the people in the state that really do rely on that,"" Duffy told Reuters.
Price impact
The Atlantic Coast gas pipe would have added an additional pipeline to deliver gas to residents of the southeast, including North Carolina and Virginia, from West Virginia.
In the winter, most of the gas there is used by homes and businesses for heat, leaving less for industries and power plants during the coldest times of year, and utility companies say the pipeline's cancellation could drive up prices.
""We'll be able to meet the needs of our customers, but we're going to have to do it in a way that is a little more expensive and has a little more reliability concerns,"" Rayhan Daudani, a spokesman for Dominion Energy's Virginia Power utility, said.
Other proposed expansions of existing pipelines in North America face national or local opposition, including TC Energy Corporation's Keystone XL in Alberta, Energy Transfer's Mariner East in Pennsylvania and Kinder Morgan Inc.'s Permian Highway in Texas.
The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in July ordered Andeavor/Tesoro, now owned by Marathon Petroleum, to stop using a pipeline flowing out of North Dakota and invoiced the company $187 million for trespass on Native American land.
Marathon said this month that the trespass order and damages had been canceled, although a new court decision was expected by Dec. 15.
This line is nearly 70 years old and its latest easement agreement with the landowners expired in 2013. While it is still operational, the dispute could result in a portion being closed.
While pipeline opponents have become focused on older pipelines, even new ones have problems. Keystone, which moves Canadian crude to the Midwest, has twice leaked thousands of bbls, even though it is about 10 years old.

CER Recommends Approval Of Edson Mainline Expansion Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) recommends that federal cabinet approve NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.’s (NGTL) Edson mainline expansion project.
The project involves the construction and operation of approximately 85 kilometres of natural gas pipeline loops in two sections, along with the associated facilities. The project is needed to increase pipeline capacity and move gas from the Peace River Project Area to growing markets in central and southern Alberta.

Commissioners heard from more than a dozen intervenors, including industry, federal and provincial government departments and Indigenous peoples. After considering the evidence and submissions presented by all parties, including Indigenous knowledge, the commission found that the project is in the Canadian public interest. As part of its recommendation, the commission included conditions related to, among other things, matters with respect to Indigenous peoples, construction activities, safety measures and standards and environmental monitoring.
Indigenous peoples raised various concerns during the hearing about potential impacts on their rights and interests. The commission, as part of its response to these concerns, recommended a number of conditions, including requiring a construction monitoring plan for the participation of Indigenous monitors during and post construction, the CER said.  
“The commission is of the view that, within this project area, any potential project impacts on the rights and interests of affected Indigenous peoples are not likely to be significant with the implementation of the mitigation measures and commitments made by NGTL, as well as the conditions and accommodations recommended and imposed by the commission,” the CER stated.
Approximately 73 kilometres (86 per cent) of the pipeline route will parallel the existing NGTL right-of-way and other existing and proposed disturbances. The commission noted that NGTL considered input from landowners, occupants, land users, Indigenous peoples and environmental studies in deciding the proposed route.
If federal cabinet approves this project, the CER will monitor and enforce compliance with all conditions using audits, inspections and other compliance and enforcement tools.

Oil Pipeline Corridor Could Offer Growth Opportunities For TC Energy | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation sees both organic and inorganic opportunities for growth along its strategic crude oil infrastructure corridor, the company’s virtual investor day heard Tuesday.
“We are proximate to growing supply basins and connected to the key U.S. markets,” said Bevin Wirzba, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines. “We continually look for ways to leverage our footprint.”
 “Growth opportunities continue to exist for those well-positioned with access to capital and TC Energy is one of those advantaged players.”
TC Energy, he said, continues to advance and develop in-corridor projects with its Heartland Pipeline, Grand Rapids Phase II and its Keystone Hardisty terminal, all of which have full regulatory approvals. Also in Alberta, the company could leverage its footprint to enhance connectivity, expanding market access and maximizing re-contracting value.
On the Gulf Coast, TC Energy could maximize the value of its existing assets, enhancing throughput and contracted volumes with minimal capital or regulatory hurdles, according to Wirzba’s presentation. The company completed its Houston tank terminal project this year, on time and under budget, giving it additional flexibility to optimize its system and create revenue opportunities, analysts heard.
The business unit team also is monitoring select inorganic opportunities, both pipeline and terminalling assets, that would complement its system, he said. “Crude exports are also expected to increase substantially between 2020 and 2040 and we see the U.S. Gulf Coast export capacity already under expansion, providing another opportunity for our business.”
“We're looking at bunts an singles and doubles, where they complement our strategic footprint today,” Wirzba said when asked about inorganic opportunities, “Leveraging our corridor, accessing new markets, providing new delivery options for our shippers is what we're getting today.”
The company sees potential growth especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in strengthening the corridor between Cushing and the Gulf Coast market and export assets, he said.
The Keystone Pipeline serves a unique demand, delivering Canadian heavy production to some of the most complex refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Midwest with a sustained demand for the product, said Wirzba. With other global sources of heavy supply in decline, the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin should be able to increase its market share going forward, he said. Production growth out of Western Canada is expected to displace approximately one billion bbls of U.S. Gulf Coast imports by 2040, analysts heard.
The Keystone pipeline is well positioned to optimize its performance going forward with refinery demand expected to recover to pre-COVID levels after the second half of 2021, according to Wirzba. He noted that Mid-Continent and U.S. Gulf Coast markets are showing signs of rebalancing following the demand shock and that refining utilization is beginning to increase.
Keystone XL 
Asked if there is anything TC Energy can do to make Keystone XL more appealing to president-elect Joe Biden, who has opposed the pipeline, Wirzba said the company has looked at the incoming Biden administration's Build Back Better plan and believe steps it has already taken have positioned the project “very favourably.”
Keystone XL will bring jobs to the economy next year, a key platform for the U.S. government as it recovers from the COVID pandemic, he said. “We've established the strong labour agreements with those four U.S. unions bringing U.S. high paying union jobs to bear which is again directly aligned with the Biden administration.”
TC Energy also has been able to set up a green training fund for training union workers to transition to those green jobs. In addition, the company has brought in Canadian First Nations as partners in the pipeline and is close to bringing in further partnerships in both Canada and the U.S. with other tribal nations, said Wirzba.
“And you've seen the public support from the Canadian federal government, even as recently as the last few weeks, upon the transition of the of the Biden administration.”
TC Energy announced Tuesday that it has signed a formal agreement with Natural Law Energy, a coalition of Canadian First Nations, which will invest up to $1 billion in Keystone XL. Outside of the investment, the pipeline company expects to create $500 million of incremental benefits to Indigenous nations through direct jobs and the use of Indigenous suppliers, said Wirzba.
 The company has completed nearly 200 kilometres of Keystone XL pipeline construction, including the international border crossing. It also has begun construction on 17 pump stations in each of the states that the project crosses as well as in Alberta. The activity has created more than 3,000 jobs with many more on the horizon as Keystone XL enters the heavy construction season in 2021.

TC Energy Has Eye On Montney Opportunities | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Forecast WCSB supply growth of up to eight bcf/d by 2030 to 23 bcf/d will provide an opportunity for TC Energy Corporation to extend its system to capture Montney region volumes, a senior executive said Tuesday.
 “We're streamlining our operations to lower costs and minimize tolls,” Tracy Robinson, executive vice-president and president of Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, told the company’s virtual investor day. “Now this brings the WCSB closer to market and helps attract more volumes to our system, particularly from the Montney region, where supply is increasing.”
The company also sees opportunities to build out the intra-Alberta market to meet growing gas demand and to unleash the capacity of the Canadian Mainline to deliver more WCSB gas into Eastern Canada and ultimately off the West Coast with the first phase of LNG Canada and what Robinson hopes will be a second phase.  
In the meantime, TC Energy’s expansion plans are progressing and will provide the growth it has promised while the company has derisked its business commercially, she said. “We are positioning this basin and our system to effectively compete for the growth in demand on this continent and globally.”
The company has brought more than $3.1 billion of new capacity into service this year and that will hit $3.3 billion by the end of this year, adding one bcf/d, on time and on budget. “This is the largest capital program we've ever completed in a single year since the [NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.] System was built and most of it was executed in the spring during the first wave of COVID, and the launch of our corporate crisis response,” said Robinson.
“We've signed long term agreements that secure our return on equity and we've continued to increase our flows and our share, despite all the challenges in the marketplace.”
The NGTL System connects to more than three-quarters of daily WCSB production of 16 bcf/d and delivers it to multiple markets across Canada and the United State through the Canadian Mainline and the company’s United States network.
About one-half of WCSB volumes of 16 bcf/d go to markets within Alberta where demand has grown by 43 per cent over the last 10 years and NGTL infrastructure has grown to accommodate it. “So despite the impacts of COVID the demand for our capacity has remained strong,” she said. “Throughput on NGTL right now is about 300 mmcf/d higher than last year, demonstrating both the resiliency and the criticality of our system.”
The company is building $10.5 billion of secured growth projects on NGTL and the Canadian Mainline over the next three years, adding 4.1 bcf/d of incremental delivery capacity and increasing WCSB delivery capacity to North American markets by 40 per cent by 2024.
NGTL’s capital growth program will add 3.5 bcf/d of delivery capacity to markets within and outside of Alberta — an increase of nearly 30 per cent in throughput.
Coastal GasLink, in which TC Energy has a 35 per cent interest, will add another 2.1 bcf/d into markets off the West Coast, creating a total of 5.6 bcf/d of new capacity to market, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over the current production of the entire basin.
Beyond North America, CGL also will provide the first direct connection for WCSB gas to global markets and “we're looking forward to helping our customers step into that market as well,” said Robinson.  “And importantly, we're doing this in a manner that has created partners of many of our stakeholders and positioned us to be a proponent of the efforts in our industry to reduce emissions.”
TC Energy also has derisked its business commercially through long-term agreements on both the NGTL System and the Mainline, securing its return on equity and providing mechanisms to drive further benefits for both it and its customers, analysts heard. “These benefits are being realized, and they're making the basin more competitive,” she said.
The Mainline settlement allowed it to reduce tolls by 35 per cent between Empress, Alberta and Emerson, Manitoba and contracting on the system has now increased to four petajoules/d — levels not seen on the system since 2007, according to Robinson.
On the NGTL System, a five-year settlement aligns TC Energy’s interest with its customers during a time of uncertainty in capital markets, she suggested.
In British Columbia, construction on Coastal GasLink continues to advance with the completion of about 31 per cent of the project’s engineering, procurement and construction activities with the full participation of its Indigenous partners. CGL has awarded 184 contracts to 84 Indigenous businesses and throughout the fall has employed about 850 Indigenous workers. “This we believe is part of executing well,” she said.
Robinson said the company works together each day with its 20 First Nations through employment, contracting opportunities, and other benefits to advance not only the project, but also the economies of many of the communities in the north. TC Energy is now adopting elements of that approach on the NGTL System through all of its projects. It has identified more than $1 billion in opportunities for Indigenous businesses and awarded about $870 million so far, she said.  
TC Energy believes that the demand for WCSB gas will grow by just over four per cent per year through 2030, driving basin production levels of 23 bcf/d. In Alberta, demand will come primarily from the increase in gas fired power generation and consumption in the industrial and oilsands sectors while North America will continue to participate in the growth of continental demand and internationally. “Our gas, we know, is competitive in Asia and perhaps beyond, fuelling growth and LNG exports,” said Robinson.
The WCSB is attractive because of the economics with more the 50 years of supply with a break-even cost at current production rates of less than $1/gigajoule, she said. “And our job is to deliver that gas competitively.”
Robinson noted that NGTL needs to spend about $500 million per year in capital investment to keep up with the “supply migration” with the 1,000 new wells drilled every year in the WCSB just to maintain production. Ensuring that production can move effectively into the marketplace, means executing its current program and expanding on that as the market opportunities grow, she said. “It also means developing new services that facilitate flow to these markets like LNG tolling solutions that help the NGTL gas access export markets through Coastal GasLink.”
In addition, TC Energy spends about $600 million a year on maintenance capital and this will increase as the system grows.
ESG
Robinson said TC Energy is committed to its expansions with an eye to sustainability which means finding innovative ways to reduce its environmental footprint, such as the technologies and the approaches it is developing to reduce fugitive emissions and gas loss during the operations. In Canada, about 10 per cent of its compression is electric which allows it to operate at lower emissions levels. In the next few years, the company will increase the amount of electric compression on its system.
Where it can't currently reduce emissions directly, TC Energy is working through cap and trade markets to permanently retire emissions from the atmosphere. In 2020, it offset 10 per cent of total emissions (700,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent) through carbon credits and it continues to seek other innovative ways to reduce its footprint. Through its base business, the company already plays a part in emissions reductions by delivering gas to Alberta's power sector, supporting the coal-to-gas conversions that have helped to reduce emissions by 30 per cent since 2015, she noted.
“And we know that the gas that will move to Asia through our Coastal GasLink system will drive the same types of emissions reductions in communities there.”
In the long term, TC Energy sees more capital investment opportunities that will lower its overall greenhouse gas emissions. It has about 3,800 megawatts of existing compression that in the right circumstances can be converted to electric power.
It also has a vast network of pipes, and that can accommodate, or can be made to accommodate, hydrogen, biomethane and other forms of renewable or carbon neutral natural gas. The company is closely monitoring the global developments in the space to understand how it may participate in a manner that supports its customers, reflects its risk profile, and drives value.

TC Energy Working To Mitigate Regulatory Risks | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The president of Canadian natural gas pipelines for TC Energy Corporation said Tuesday she hopes the five-month delay by the federal government in approving the 2021 NGTL expansion is a “one-off occurrence.”
“But as we know, in the regulatory environment that we are in, the process is getting longer and far more complex and we are doing and that all that we can to mitigate that,” Tracy Robinson, a TC Energy, executive vice-president, told analysts at the company’s virtual investor day. “We are getting to know our new regulator well in trying to stay ahead of those concerns.”
NGTL, she said, is designing its infrastructure to minimize impact and is working hard to ensure it is “ahead of the game” when it comes to landowners, stakeholders and Indigenous leaders. “This difficulty in building infrastructure is something that is happening across North America but I would say in the NGTL System we are positioned well,” said Robinson.  In this case, it’s straightforward because nearly all of it is in-corridor expansion, looping pipe and adding compression, she said.
“We work with the stakeholders we know very well, and we have a team who knows how to do this well.”

TC Energy Eager To Capitalize On Growing Mexican Natural Gas Opportunities | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A forecast growth rate of about 2.3 per cent per year through 2040 is driving increased low cost natural gas imports into Mexico from the United States and TC Energy Corporation wants to provide the needed pipelines, an investor day heard Tuesday.
“The fundamentals are strong, our execution is strong, the country risks are manageable, and we're well-positioned to be Mexico's energy infrastructure company of choice for many, many years to come,” said Stan Chapman, executive vice-president and president of U.S. and Mexico natural gas pipelines.
U.S. imports are expected to grow to eight bcf/d by 2040 from five bcf/d in 2019, he said.
TC Energia was established in 1995 and has continued to grow as its five operating pipelines now transport about 25 per cent of the natural gas consumed in the country, analysts heard.  
 “The build-out of our pipeline infrastructure provides a critical link to the U.S., enabling Mexico's energy transformation to thrive as the country shifts from fuel oil to natural gas,” said Chapman. The Sur de Texas pipeline now transports about 20 per cent of U.S. natural gas imports into Mexico.
The business is further reinforced by strong fundamentals, which has seen natural gas demand increase by 65 per cent since 2000, analysts heard.
The combination of historical demand and future growth strongly support the need for the Villa de Reyes and Tula projects which TC Energy is advancing in partnership with the CFE (Comisión Federal De Electricidad), the state power company. Under the low risk model, 99 per cent of revenues are underpinned with long-term take-or -pay contracts paid in U.S. dollars, Chapman noted.
In 2020, TC Energy continued to enhance its pipeline network by completing the Tula East segment and the Guadalajara pipeline flow reversal, which effective Dec. 1, 2020 will displace more expensive LNG imports with natural gas from the Permian Basin. 
And despite the COVID pandemic, it has progressed construction on the Villa de Reyes project and advanced contractual negotiations with CFE on both the Villa de Reyes and Tula projects.
The Villa de Reyes project is now 94 per cent complete. Earlier this year, the pandemic closed the court systems across Mexico, which in turn drove delays in resolving several local injunctions related to right-of-way acquisition for the project, said Chapman. Once those are resolved, construction along those segments is expected to take about six weeks and the company believes it can have the project in service by the middle of 2021.
Although the east and western segments of the Tula project are complete, the central or mountain segment remains suspended due to government and government mandated Indigenous discussions. “With the eastern segment complete and the system fully loaded, we're optimistic that will reach agreement with the CFE to begin making deliveries to markets off of that segment by year-end,” he said. 
TC Energy will continue to work with the Mexican government and CFE on a resolution to the central section which could include the potential for a reroute to avoid Indigenous concerns, said Chapman.  A full in-service of the Tula project is expected somewhere around two years after either the consultations or rewrite discussions are concluded.
“Given our complementary relationship with CFE and their need to increase utilization of existing capacity they hold on upstream pipes in the U.S., our prospects for additional growth continue to be promising,” he said. The company continues to have productive discussions with CFE on cross-border projects, which could lead to new in-corridor expansion opportunities, according to Chapman.
The viability of LNG exports from the Permian Basin (Waha) to the Pacific also has increased, given the geographical advantage of ports in Western Mexico which enable shipments to avoid the Panama Canal, he said. In one recently-announced project, the gas will be supplied by TC Energy’s North Baja pipeline in the U.S. Additional LNG projects are planned, mainly for the second half of the decade.
As Mexican demand continues to emerge, future in-corridor expansions will be driven by CFE’s need to install additional gas fired power generation and to address reliability concerns from bottlenecks from existing third-party pipelines, said Chapman. “And lastly, don't discount the potential for new market connections.”
In the near term, the company will close out its Villa de Reyes and Tula projects, he said. In the long term, it will look to capitalize on robust market fundamentals, a strategically placed system and its history of strong execution to ensure it competes for — and most importantly wins— its share of additional growth going forward.

Enbridge Gas In $5.2-Million Hydrogen Blending Pilot Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Gas Inc. and Cummins Inc., with the support of Sustainable Development Technology Canada (STDC), are undertaking a $5.2 million project to pilot the blending of renewable hydrogen produced at the Markham, Ontario-located power-to-gas facility, into a portion of the existing natural gas network serving about 3,600 customers in Markham in 2021.
This low carbon hydrogen-blending project is the first of its kind in North America and is an important step in greening the gas supply that millions of Ontario homeowners and businesses depend on to heat their homes and energize industry, the companies said. The successful implementation will support Enbridge Gas in pursuing additional and larger scale hydrogen blending activities in other parts of its distribution system.
Enbridge said it is helping to drive Ontario's transition to a clean energy future through investments in clean energy opportunities across multiple markets. This includes hydrogen and renewable natural gas produced from organic waste, which can green the natural gas supply by reducing the amount of traditional or geological natural gas and reducing GHG emissions. These clean energy projects have the additional benefit of being made-in-Ontario clean-energy solutions which use existing pipeline infrastructure.

"CER, Indigenous Monitors Complete 50th Joint Compliance Verification On Trans Mountain | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Canada Energy Regulator (CER) inspection officers and Indigenous monitors for the Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring Committee (IAMC-TMX) recently completed the 50th joint compliance verification activity of the Trans Mountain expansion project and existing line.
Leading up to this milestone, IAMC-TMX Indigenous monitors led two recent inspections which focused on assessing the company's mitigation of impacts on sites of importance to Indigenous peoples in British Columbia and Alberta. These are some of the first Indigenous monitor-led joint inspections with a Canadian federal regulator, and an exciting step forward in the CER and IAMC-TMX's partnership.
Since 2017, Indigenous monitors for the IAMC-TMX have regularly participated in oversight of the Trans Mountain expansion and existing line with the CER, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Parks Canada. This includes working with the CER to participate in emergency management exercises, safety and environmental protection inspections, and socio-economic reviews. Through this collaboration, CER inspection officers learn about Indigenous values and world views with respect to risk, while Indigenous monitors learn about the CER's inspection process.

Opportunities Exist For Canadian Heavy Crude To Make Up For Shortfalls In The U.S. Gulf Coast | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
This is the second piece in our week-long heavy oil series. For the first piece, click on the link below:
Martin King: Outlook For Heavy Oil Supply And Refinery Demand Suggests Price Differentials To Remain Tight

U.S. Gulf Coast refineries have made significant investments in technology that processes heavy crude in recent decades, and with the availability of heavy crude oil from other sources like Venezuela and Mexico declining those refineries will require larger volumes from Canada.
While crude markets continue to be volatile amid COVID-19 disruptions and Canadian heavy oil exports to the U.S. have fallen sharply this year, industry experts expect the tide will eventually turn and prospects for Canadian heavy producers are set to improve going forward.
“The heavy oil situation is looking good. Relative to where heavy oil imports into the U.S. [were] in early 2018, we’re down over one million barrels a day. That’s basically showing that there’s capacity in the U.S. to consume a lot more crude,” said Jackie Forrest, managing director at ARC Financial Corp. and executive director of the ARC Energy Research Institute.
“They consumed almost five million barrels a day at one point and now the imports are closer to four million barrels a day and part of that is the lost imports from Venezuela due to sanctions. But the other thing is there’s actually been a reduction in supply from Mexico, as well as from other major exporters of heavy oil to the U.S.,” she added.
“Meanwhile, Canada’s actually been increasing and going the other way.”
With dwindling exports from other heavy oil producing countries, Canadian producers may be in a good position to capitalize.
“Now there’s ample capacity in the Gulf Coast to consume more heavy oil. They have the equipment so there’s an opportunity for Canada to grow into that market,” she said.
Allan Fogwill, president and CEO of the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI), also believes U.S. demand for Canadian heavy is set to increase.
“Yes, it will. It’s a simple supply and demand equation. The U.S. is in the position of needing that heavy crude for their refineries and they’re going to have to get it from someone and they’re losing out on two of three supply basins,” he said.
“One is, of course, Venezuela and the second is Mexico and the third is Canada. Canada can pick up the slack as much as possible given pipeline access and rail capacity,” Fogwill added.
“The only other observation I have is the heavy crude market seems to have some strong demand fundamentals behind it and, as a result, it could also provide medium-term support for additional production at higher prices.”
Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage told the Energy Intelligence Forum Oct. 13 that a full recovery in Alberta's oilsands will require higher prices, as well as a rebound in demand in the U.S., which buys about 97 per cent of Canada's crude exports.
""To get production fully back to where it was, we're going to be needing [higher prices], demand and upstream investment,"" Savage said.
If those market conditions eventually prevail, the province will be well-positioned to regain market share if not increase it, as oilsands crude is similar in properties to the heavy crude from declining producers Venezuela and Mexico, she added.
""We see that there are many competitive advantages to the oilsands. Unlike other sources of oil, [heavy crude] is in demand,” Savage said.
According to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), in pre-pandemic 2019 heavy crude oil accounted for 76 per cent of all crude oil exported from Canada. From 2018 to 2019 heavy crude oil exports increased one per cent from 2.81 million bbls/d to 2.85 million bbls/d, with the vast majority of the volumes landing in the Gulf Coast at PADD III. During the five years leading up to year-end 2019, heavy crude oil exports increased 31 per cent.
The changing global heavy oil market landscape
Kevin Birn, vice-president, North American Crude Oil Markets, IHS Markit, says the firm has published two reports analyzing the Canadian heavy oil-U.S. Gulf Coast dynamic: Looking south: A Canadian perspective on the U.S. Gulf Coast heavy oil market and Looking north: A U.S. perspective on Canadian heavy oil.
And a key takeaway was that opportunities for Canadian heavy players look set to improve as the global heavy oil market continues to evolve and change.
“When we look at the heavy oil market globally it’s only about 10 million barrels a day in terms of the supply and demand situation. And what we’ve seen is increasing demand for heavy and decreasing availability of supply,” he told the Bulletin.
“There’s been investments made in certain parts of the world to optimize a greater percentage of the whole barrel. So every barrel of oil has a different composition of its fractions that make different products,” he added.
“And we’ve seen investments being incentivized — like Russia, for example — to maximize the bottom ends of the barrel: The heavy, sour residue material as opposed to exporting an unfinished or partially finished product to Europe where some of those refineries are processing.
He added: “You can think of it as increasing demand or contraction of availability of supply. It’s the same thing.”
And that changing supply and demand dynamic is also being illustrated in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
“A lot of that refining complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast was built up in the ‘80s and ‘90s really to optimize and take advantage of growing heavy, sour supply from Latin America. And what we’ve seen is declining availability of Latin American heavy crude oil. Mexico has been having long-term structural declines just due to the maturity of that production. It’s been a gradual falling, not dramatic,” Birn said.
“But Venezuela is the poster child. In the last half-decade we’ve seen a contraction of over one million barrels a day of export supply. There is no question that Venezuela has massive reserves and production potential, but the challenges in that country are all surface,” he added.
“So even if suddenly there is some great stabilization and normalization in Venezuela it’s going to take years to recover the human capital, let alone the physical infrastructure that needs to be fixed in that country.”
And that has left the U.S. Gulf Coast refinery complex in a position of trying to source out alternative supplies of comparable heavy crude. And one of the beneficiaries has been the Canadian heavy oil sector.
“We’ve seen evidence of challenges in doing that in the Gulf Coast. The price differential between light and heavy crudes is narrowing to the benefit of the Canadian producers,” Birn said.
He noted that “to a large degree” Canadian heavy crude has been offsetting the decline of available heavy sour product to the Gulf Coast.
“And that’s been to the benefit of U.S. refiners, as well as Canadian producers,” Birn said.


‘Unprecedented levels of interest’ in the U.S. Gulf Coast: MEG CEO
For instance Derek Evans, president and CEO of MEG Energy Corp., told analysts during a third quarter conference call that his company is “seeing unprecedented levels of interest in our heavy crude” in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
“[And] not only for U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, but … in the Caribbean as well as obviously you saw the Reliance deal and that product moving to India,” Evans said.
“So we think there has been a step rate change even before you start to consider the [Enbridge Inc.’s] Line 3 project … which should come on in mid-2021. And it’s surprising to us, but people continue to still think that TMX isn’t going to get built, even though there is numerous pipeline spreads out with pipeline in the ground,” he added.
“And as we have pointed out here again today, I think people have forgotten that we have 20,000 barrels a day of long-haul capacity. So I think directionally, we are back in a position where pipeline capacity, egress capability is not going to be as big a problem as it has been in the past. That should be reflected in the differentials. And that really is our thesis on why we believe there has been a step rate change, and that is very positive for our business, obviously.”
Evans said there are other positive factors in play that will also benefit MEG and heavy oil producers.
“We appear to be, or sound to be, more constructive than others may be in terms of the WCS-WTI differentials. We would point to the fact that storage levels in Alberta are at some of the lowest that we have seen historically. We have seen continued small improvements on both the Enbridge system and on the Keystone system. We have got the North West upgrader actually running and processing heavy,” Evans said.
“All three of those add somewhere in the neighborhood of 150,000 barrels a day of incremental demand.”
Evans said MEG sold 62 per cent of its sales volumes to the U.S. Gulf Coast in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 35 per cent in the second quarter of 2020.
“This increase in sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast in the third quarter of 2020 is primarily as a result of the corporation’s increased contracted transportation capacity on the Flanagan South/Seaway pipeline systems effective July 1, increasing from 50,000 barrels a day to 100,000 barrels a day,” he said.
Challenges for Canadian heavy producers persist
Birn and Forrest both say some all too familiar challenges remain for Canadian heavy crude producers and their ability to truly take advantage of the current and projected North American heavy oil market given shrinking volumes from other exporting nations.
“The reality is the Canadian upstream has suffered from challenges associated with pipeline egress which have impacted the value of Canadian crude which then impacts the incentive to invest further in the upstream in Canada. And even prior to COVID we saw a slowing growth story in the Canadian upstream, right? I don’t think that’s particularly news,” Birn said.
“So the challenges still remain the same, even if COVID is masking them temporarily. Western Canada needs improved egress opportunities for its crude to basically ensure greater price stability and narrower differentials, on average.”
While Birn wants “to be clear” that pipelines aren’t going to narrow the differential below pipeline economics — which is where they are now — they would go a long way in the reducing volatility faced by Canadian producers in recent years.
“If you look on average over the last half-decade you see a region of incredible price volatility in addition to, and above, what’s been going on globally. And uncertainty harms investment and we have a more uncertain region than others,” he said.
“So the promise of greater egress could help stabilize the differentials and, on average, they have the potential to be narrower than what we’ve see, in recent years. It de-risks Western Canada and the oil and gas sector from a number of uncertainties right now, the greatest and most traumatic and most immediate and probably the most temporary of which is COVID.”
Forrest agrees that for Canada to meet increased U.S. demand for heavy oil, increased upstream investment will be key.
“You would need to see new investment if you wanted to grow. By the way, I do think there will be some incremental growth because we have some existing projects that with curtailment maybe didn’t produce at their maximum level,” she said.
“And there’s some debottlenecking and incremental things that have happened that I think will increase the production. But we’re probably not going to see a million barrels a day of growth if we don’t make new capital investments in Canada. So I think that’s a constraint.”
Like Birn, Forrest said that pipeline egress continues to be an issue.
“We also would need more takeaway capacity because if we don’t get additional takeaway capacity then that would be a barrier, I think, to filling all that potential demand that there is,” she said.
“Enbridge’s Line 3 will help but that only goes into the Midwest, although there’s some additional capacity to move crude oil into the Gulf Coast from there. But it’s limited.”
Although its future very much remain clouded, Forrest said TC Energy’s Keystone XL pipeline “would be helpful” to connect any increase in oilsands supply to the Gulf Coast in an effort to make up for the heavy oil shortfall there.
“So transportation is part of the challenge, too. If we end up having to move by rail we could do that, too, but the economics wouldn’t be as good,” she said.
Looking forward, Birn and IHS Markit does “see some cautious optimism” in the potential to see some improvements to the takeaway situation eventually coming to fruition.
“The pipelines seem to be moving forward and reasonably on schedule. That doesn’t rule out delay, but the build-up of where they are on timing a potential delay of one may not result in a differential blowout,” he said.
“The key here is price stability. On the other side is that narrowing global light-heavy spread means that the value of heavy crude relative to light oil will be greater on average than it was before,” Birn added.
“And when you couple these things together the basic bottom line is you do see a scenario for improved price stability and a greater and more stable investment climate, but also better netbacks for western Canadian producers, on average, over the next decade. The price track right now is low and we may be lower for longer but the differentials may be narrower, as well.”
Birn added that a growing global push to expedite the energy transition and the desire of many investors and governments to see more stringent environment, social and governance screening implemented across industries is also a factor going forward.
“As a result, greater discounting of future production and reserves and this is going to weigh on oil and gas globally. In the case of the Canadian oilsands, it also suffers from an additional problem of a negative reputation that will impair,” Birn said.
“But I do think with the egress issue, in addition to and on top of all the other challenges, these are very material to the actual returns on the production itself.”

TC Energy ‘Well Positioned’ For Growth | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation says that it is “well positioned” to capture significant additional growth opportunities as the world both consumes more energy and transitions to a less carbon intensive energy mix.
The company this morning is hosting its investor day, which the DOB is covering and we will file reports from the event later today. At today’s event, the company will provide a financial update and review strategic plans for its natural gas pipelines, liquids pipelines and power and storage businesses in Canada, the United States and Mexico.
“Our network of critical energy infrastructure will be used extensively for decades to come and continue to generate significant in-corridor growth potential,” said the company.
“As the world transitions to a low-carbon future, new prospects are expected to emerge. With a deep understanding of energy markets, strong stakeholder relationships, significant financial capacity, and extensive technical expertise across a broad range of energy sources including natural gas, crude oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and other emerging technologies, we expect to continue to grow our portfolio in a manner that aligns with our risk preferences, return expectations and organizational capabilities.”
 “Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, our $100 billion portfolio of high-quality, long-life energy infrastructure assets remain resilient as evidenced by near record financial results expected again in 2020,” said Russ Girling, TC Energy’s president and chief executive officer. “Looking forward, we continue to advance $37 billion of commercially secured projects that will expand and extend our asset footprint across North America. Notably, these projects are underpinned by cost of service regulation and/or long-term, take-or-pay contracts.”
 “Our secured capital program, along with a robust portfolio of other projects under development, is expected to drive future growth in earnings and cash flow per share. Based on the confidence we have in our business plan, we are reaffirming that we expect to grow our common share dividend at an annual rate of eight to 10 per cent in 2021 and five to seven per cent thereafter,” added Girling. “Our dividend outlook is in line with our historical approach to capital allocation and consistent with average annual increases in the dividend since 2000.”

TC Energy Inks Formal Agreement With Natural Law Energy For Indigenous Equity | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Following a MOU announced in September, TC Energy Corporation and Natural Law Energy (NLE) have signed a definitive agreement which allows NLE to make an equity investment of up to $1 billion in the Keystone XL pipeline project.
The first phase of the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, with the transaction contingent on NLE securing financing. The agreement also contemplates NLE pursuing an interest in future Liquids projects.
Although the terms of the agreement are confidential, Natural Law Energy will hold a minority interest in the project that will continue after the Alberta government sells its equity interest, Bevin Wirzba, executive vice-president and president of liquids pipelines, said at today’s investment day.
The agreement also contemplates NLE’s investment in future liquids projects and those identified directly related to the Keystone XL project moving forward, he said.  Those could include its terminalling assets at Hardisty that already have regulatory approval and other direct tie-in type projects into the XL system that could further enhance the company’s ability to drive value out of that asset base.
“We'll continue to monitor our project execution going forward and the new elements of opportunities that come up and we’ll work with them as partners to see if it makes sense to bring them as partners in those asset opportunities as well,” said Wirzba.
""This agreement is a reflection of the meaningful way NLE is choosing to participate in a long-term partnership on the Keystone XL pipeline,” said Richard Prior, president, Keystone XL Pipeline. “This partnership will facilitate important input and guidance from NLE on the project as we make this the most sustainable and safest pipeline ever developed. It will also enable the realization of long-term, meaningful economic benefits derived from an attractive return of and on NLE’s investment.”
 “Natural Law Energy has used the same blueprint our ancestors used when they negotiated the Treaties that governed working together to share the land,” said Travis Meguinis, CEO of Natural Law Energy. “Today, we’re pleased to announce that NLE’s definitive agreement is one of the largest ever with over $1 billion deal for First Nations. We’re a major contributor to economic developments on our traditional lands and will create opportunities for future generations. As an Indigenous led company, we need to ensure sustainability to Mother Earth and share our understanding as stewards of the land by bringing our traditional protocols and values to these projects.”
 “This is a historical moment for First Nations and TC Energy. It’s going to benefit many generations to come. Thirty to 40 years from now, Nekaneet First Nation members will see the opportunities through this definitive agreement by creating inter-generational wealth for many generations to come,” said Chief Alvin Francis, president of Natural Law Energy and Chief of Nekaneet First Nation.
 “This represents our first investment in Canada’s energy infrastructure and we are excited to partner with TC Energy as together, we will ensure that the pipeline is held to the highest levels of environmental and social responsibility,” added Francis.
As the project advances through construction, TC Energy will apply this ownership model to create opportunities for additional Indigenous communities along the Keystone XL corridor both in Canada and the Unites States. This initiative is in addition to the more than $600 million in Indigenous supplier and employment opportunities expected to be created through the project’s construction, the company said.
 “Natural Law Energy believes in proactively advancing new economic growth and opportunities for the next seven generations by creating valuable relationships with industry and government.  We are committed to value projects such as Keystone XL to ensure we are achieving multi-generational social and financial well-being of the nations partnered with NLE,” said Brian Mountain, executive director of Natural Law Energy. “Our current relationship with TC Energy is a great example of what reconciliation looks like between our Indigenous communities and industry.”

"‘No Government Contracts' For Companies That Don't Manufacture In U.S., Biden Vows | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– Now that he’s the president-elect, Joe Biden is doubling down on his promise that economic recovery efforts in the United States will remain a made-in-America endeavour.
Biden, who was vice-president when Canada last confronted a Democrat’s protectionist Buy American provisions, pared the commitment down to a simple sound bite Monday during a speech from his base of operations in Delaware.
“From autos to our stockpiles, we're going to buy American,'' Biden said.
""No government contracts will be given to companies that don't make their products here in America.""
It was a succinct and unmistakable distillation of the Buy American plan Biden laid out during the election campaign, which includes a specialized “Made in America'' office within the White House to enforce and oversee the measures.
It took Canada nearly a year to negotiate waivers to similar rules in 2010 when Barack Obama's administration was preparing to spend more than $800 billion to bounce back from the Great Recession.
Biden's plan also includes executive orders to more strictly enforce, expand and tighten the provisions, a strategy to make U.S. products more competitive and to expand the list of ""critical materials"" that must be American-made.
And ever since it was unveiled, Canadian officials on both sides of the border, including Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, have been talking about plans to sell the U.S. on a different approach: “Buy North American.''
“When I think of resiliency, if there are two countries where the supply chains are integrated, it’s Canada and the United States,'' Champagne said Monday when asked about Biden's remarks.
What looms is a chance to capitalize on that integration and create millions of jobs in both the U.S. and Canada, Champagne said.
“The big prize for us is to say, how can we innovate more together, how can we manufacture more together, how can we sell more together to the rest of the world?''
At virtually the same time Biden was speaking Monday, the House of Commons in Ottawa unanimously passed a motion tabled by NDP House leader Peter Julian to invite Biden to address Parliament once he is sworn in as president.
Julian intended the motion as a show of goodwill and bilateral teamwork on issues like climate change and “social and economic justice,'' he tweeted. But the Conservatives put a different spin on their decision to support it.
“The fate of the Keystone XL pipeline is now in question and is an urgent issue that requires immediate attention,'' Conservative MP Michael Chong said in a statement following the vote.
“Conservatives expect that the prime minister will emphasize the importance of Keystone XL to ensure that this important project continues to move forward for the benefit of Canadian and American workers.''
The fate of the plan to expand the pipeline, which would ferry over 800,000 bbls more per day of diluted bitumen from the Alberta oilsands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, has been in question for years.
But the latest uncertainty about the pipeline is a direct result of Biden's own campaign, which issued a statement in May that promised to “stop it for good” by rescinding President Donald Trump's approvals for the multibillion-dollar project.
There again, Canada’s advocates talk about the need for an integrated approach, discussing energy and the environment as two sides of the same mutually beneficial coin.
“Canada's one of the only major suppliers to the U.S. that has a price on carbon, that has a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,'' Kirsten Hillman, Canada's envoy to Washington, said in a recent interview.
“Even if we are transitioning to a lower carbon economy, we're going to need these forms of fuel for a long time.”

Environmental Groups Appeal Illinois Order Allowing Dakota Pipeline Expansion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Environmental groups are appealing a decision made last month by Illinois regulators to allow the expansion of the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), according to documents filed with the state on Friday.
The Illinois Commerce Commission last month voted to approve an application to roughly double the capacity of Energy Transfer LP’s 557,000 bbl/d crude oil pipeline after legal pushback by environmental groups delayed the vote by about a year.
Save Our Illinois Land and Sierra Club, which have led the fight to block the project, filed an application for a rehearing with the ICC, the first step before appealing to state district court.
The groups have argued that expanding DAPL, the largest pipeline running out of North Dakota’s Bakken shale basin, posed safety and environmental risks and that an oil market downturn has diminished any need for the project.
Dallas-based Energy Transfer has countered that the downturn would be temporary and has said DAPL, which delivers crude to Patoka, Ill., has had a clean safety record since entering service in 2017. The project has received approvals from several other U.S. states.
Energy Transfer was not immediately available for comment.
The company is currently embroiled in a bigger legal battle over DAPL, which is under threat of being shut down by a federal district court.
Energy Transfer and DAPL's minority owners are appealing rulings earlier this year by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordering an environmental review of a portion of the line and vacating one of its key permits.
Meanwhile, the district court is considering an injunction to shut the line while the review is carried out. Its decision is expected in the next two months.

Feedback Sought By AER On Proposed Changes To Pipeline Rules | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is seeking feedback on proposed changes to the pipeline rules which it implements under the authority of the Pipeline Act.
The proposed changes include modernization of the rules, last reviewed and updated in 2005, to align them with the latest safety and integrity management standards set by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and with pipeline safety recommendations from the Alberta auditor general in 2015. Proposed changes also would reduce the environmental footprint of pipelines and reduce the administrative burden on pipeline operators.
Under the proposed changes, all new pipelines would have to accommodate the passage of pigs, with some exemptions. The AER also has provided additional guidance around existing pipelines that may not meet minimum cover requirements or that may need to consider adequacy of existing cover.
In alignment with the CSA Z662: 19 Oil & Gas Pipeline Systems (CSA Z662), companies must have a Safety and Loss Management System (SLMS) and Integrity Management Programs (IMPs), which is supported by additional requirements and guidance.
The proposed changes incorporate principles from SLMS and IMP and are risk-based and outcome-focused. Based on these proposed changes, the AER says many prescriptive and duplicate requirements are being removed in favour of criteria to be developed by the licensee through its SLMS and IMP.
Based on certain conditions, licensees will have up to 24 months, rather than 12 months, to discontinue, abandon, or resume a pipeline. If the intent is to discontinue or abandon a pipeline system, a licensee would be able to do so without the removal of underground tie-ins, subject to stated requirements.
An overall exemption clause added to allow the regulator to build additional programs related to abandonment, such as the area-based closure program. Conducting removal activities would follow the same process as discontinuation and abandonment processes.
The AER will accept feedback through Jan. 15, 2021. It  will review all feedback that may be used in finalizing changes to the rules that are subject to final review and approval by the Alberta government. A release date for the updated rules has not been set.

"Westcoast Energy Fined $40,000 For Blast Near Prince George, B.C. | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(The Canadian Press) –– Westcoast Energy has been fined for failing to prevent a fiery pipeline blast northeast of Prince George, B.C., two years ago that led to natural gas shortages in the province through the winter.
The Enbridge Inc. subsidiary was issued the $40,000 fine after the Canada Energy Regulator determined Westcoast did not adequately implement a stress corrosion monitoring program that would have identified the problem section of the pipe.
In its final report released in March, the Transportation Safety Board said the 90-centimetre pipeline that supplies much of southern B.C. ruptured due to stress corrosion cracks on the outside surface of the pipe.
The safety board said the company didn't follow its own procedures in technical assessment and approvals before deciding to defer the inspection that may have identified the cracks.
Since the blast, an Enbridge spokeswoman says the company has paid the fine as well as completed enhanced inspections on its natural gas pipeline system and undertaken an aggressive integrity program to prevent future incidents.
No one was hurt in the Oct. 9, 2018, explosion but 125 people within a two-kilometre radius had to be evacuated as a precaution.
“Since the Shelley incident, we’ve completed a comprehensive pipeline integrity program on our natural gas pipeline system in B.C. to prevent similar incidents from occurring and to significantly improve pipeline safety. This is the most aggressive integrity program ever undertaken by Enbridge on its pipeline system in B.C.,'' said Tracie Kenyon, Enbridge's senior corporate communications advisor.
Kenyon said the company understands the concerns and disruptions faced by people living in the area, and has taken steps to ensure the safety of its natural gas system.

Inter Pipeline’s Heartland Petrochemical Complex Still On Track For 2022 In-service Date | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
While managing COVID during construction at Inter Pipeline Ltd.’s Heartland Petrochemical Complex has had an impact, the project remained on track in the third quarter of 2020, within the $4 billion revised budget and an expected in-service date of early 2022.  
“I remain very, very pleased with how our teams and our contractors have managed their way through this difficult environment,” Christian Bayle, president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call to discuss third quarter 2020 results.
 “Productivity is astoundingly high on site where we're at about 3,000 people,” he said. “Our mitigation efforts are working, [we] have had no verified cases of on-site transmission of COVID and we remain confident that we're going to be able to manage our way through these difficult times, even as cases ramp up.”
Of the estimated $500 million in incremental costs for the project, about $150 million is COVID management mitigation expenditures and an estimate for a rather modest drop in overall productivity on-site, said Bayle.
Inter Pipeline invested $176.3 million in the project in the third quarter of 2020, bringing total project spending since inception to approximately $2.9 billion.
Work completed in the quarter included the final design, grading, ballasting and laying of track for its rail operations. Inter Pipeline expects to connect the Heartland facility track to Canadian Pacific Railway Limited mainline in early 2021. In addition, the pelletizer and extruder equipment were installed polypropylene facility had the complex's pelletizer and extruder equipment installed.
Inter Pipeline intends to have the more complex PDH (propane dehydrogenation facility) mechanically complete by the late spring of 2021, followed by the PP (polypropylene) facility later in 2021, analysts heard.
Bayle said the process to secure a partner to purchase a material interest in the complex is ongoing and is expected to conclude in the first half of 2021. However, because potential partners are from around the world, COVID also has made the process more logistically challenging, adding more time to the process but “we’re planning for that,” he said.
Inter Pipeline posted net income of $38.7 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2020, down from $79.9 million in the comparable quarter, while net income for the nine months declined to $190.3 from $438.5 million a year earlier.
Funds from operations (FFO) totalled $196 million in the third quarter (2019-$204.4 million) and $587.9 million for the nine months (2019-$656.1 million). Revenue for the three and nine months was $632.9 million (2019-590.8 million) and $1.78 billion (2019-$1.89 billion) respectively.
Corporate costs for the quarter increased to $77.9 million, primarily due to one-time transaction costs associated with the divestment of the majority of the European bulk liquid storage business and an unrealized foreign exchange hedging loss.
Total capital expenditures were $222.8 million which included $205.5 million in growth capital. Capex for the nine months was $1.53 billion of which $1.11 billion was growth capital.
The payout ratio was 26.3 per cent for the quarter (2019-86.6 per cent) and 48.3 per cent for the nine months (2019-80.3 per cent).
Oilsands transportation
Funds from operations for the oilsands transportation business in the third quarter of 2020 were $155.2 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $152.5 million in the 2019 quarter. Inter Pipeline attributed the increase primarily to higher capital fee revenue on the Cold Lake pipeline system. 
Throughput volume averaged 1,062,000 bbls/d for the third quarter 2020 compared to 1,183,500 bbls/d for the same period in 2019. The result reflects turnaround activities at the Scotford upgrader, Muskeg River and Jackpine mines, as well as lower diluent deliveries to the Kearl and Sunrise oilsands projects.
NGL processing 
Third quarter funds from operations for the NGL processing business segment increased 10 per cent to $50.9 million from $46.2 million in the 2019 due primarily to higher paraffinic frac-spread and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower olefinic and propane-plus frac-spread pricing.
Inter Pipeline's straddle plants processed 2.95 bcf/d of natural gas per day and produced 105,500 bbls/d of natural gas liquids in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 3.21 bcf/d and 105,900 bbls/d respectively during the same period in 2019.
Total pipeline throughput averaged 1,222,000 bbls/d.
Conventional oil pipelines 
Inter Pipeline's conventional oil pipelines segment generated funds from operations of $31.5 million in the third quarter of 2020, down from $39.7 million in the 2019 quarter as results were affected by lower global energy prices which resulted in production curtailments and reduced marketing activities.
Throughput on Inter Pipeline's three conventional gathering systems averaged 159,800 bbls/d during the third quarter of 2020 compared to 183,900 bbls/d in the third quarter of 2019. Throughput volume continued to recover and were up approximately 20,000 bbls/d from the second quarter of 2020.
In the third quarter, Inter Pipeline agreed to acquire the Milk River pipeline system from Plains Midstream Canada ULC, in exchange for its 100 per cent ownership interest in the Empress II and 50 per cent ownership interest in the Empress V straddle plants. Inter Pipeline will also receive cash proceeds of $35 million.
The Milk River pipeline system is comprised of two 16-kilometre pipelines with current throughput volume of approximately 90,000 bbls/d, linking Inter Pipeline's Bow River pipeline system from Milk River to the U.S./Canadian border west of Coutts, Alberta. Closing of this transaction is expected to occur in early 2021, following completion of customary conditions.
Also in the quarter, the company entered an agreement to divest the majority of its European storage business for approximately $715 million.
Financing activity
As at Sept. 30, 2020, Inter Pipeline had $2.1 billion of available committed capacity on its existing revolving credit facilities, and is well positioned to fund near-term planned capital expenditures, including remaining costs for the Heartland Petrochemical Complex. At quarter end, Inter Pipeline had a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of 44.5 per cent, significantly below the maximum covenant level of 65 per cent.
Alberta Petrochemical Incentive Program
Asked about the Alberta government’s recently announced petrochemicals incentive program, Bayle said Inter Pipeline is looking carefully at the program with regard to its Heartland complex and how it may or may not play a role. “It certainly improves the economics of other future petrochemical investments because it’s a meaningful reduction in the offsetting capital spend in Alberta if we can qualify for what is about 12 per cent [grant] based off certain aspects of capital,” he said.
One of the benefits of the new program is that Inter Pipeline has an opportunity to roll in the royalty credits it received for its PDH plant under the previous petrochemical incentive program, said Bayle. “It changes from a royalty credit into essentially a cash payment and therefore there’s no potential leakage in terms of having to monetize a royalty credit.”

Prince George Refinery Continues To Strengthen Tidewater Results | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Continuing strong performance of the Prince George Refinery (PGR) which achieved 95 per cent utilization and the Pipestone gas plant helped Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. achieve record third quarter results in 2020.  
Diesel demand is continuing to outpace supply at Prince George due to large infrastructure projects in the area, including the Site C dam, Coastal GasLink, Trans Mountain and LNG Canada, Joel MacLeod, president, chief executive officer and chair, said in a conference call to discuss third quarter results.
And while the majority of North American refineries have significant contraction in margins, the PGR margin has held above a $45/bbl crack spread, he added.
Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended Sept.30,  2020 increased by 86 per cent to $47.6 million from $25.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 and to $130.98 million for the nine months (2019-$69.69 million).
The net loss attributable to shareholders was $1.98 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $11.05 million in the third quarter of 2019 due to a non-cash loss on disposition of certain non-core assets. The net loss for the nine months was $41.92 million versus a loss of $176,000 the previous year.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $63.93 million for the quarter (2019 - negative $2.4 million) with distributable cash flow of $10.58 million (2019-$12.14 million) and a payout ratio of 32 per cent (2019-28 per cent).
Volumes across Tidewater operations have returned to pre-pandemic levels and it continues to see increased demand at PGR as a result of large infrastructure projects in central and northern British Columbia resulting in a stronger market for refined products. The refinery continues to operate at record throughput, at times exceeding 12,000 bbls/day with combined gasoline and diesel production from PGR of more than 10,500 bbls/day.
PGR
Tidewater attributed the refinery utilization of more than 95 per cent to the planned maintenance program at the refinery during the second quarter of 2020 and increased demand for refined products due to the reduced social quarantine restrictions by the provincial and federal governments.
The company also realized improved margins as a result of increased refined product pricing. Butane blending also enabled Tidewater to blend low value butane into the PGR gasoline pool.
MacLeod told analysts that the company is in a strong strategic position to become a leader in clean fuels across Canada and to well to benefit from renewable energy and clean fuel stimulus. Its canola processing project, which was initiated over 18 months ago, will come online in late 2021.
With the support of the British Columbia government, Tidewater also is currently evaluating a $150 million renewable diesel project at the Prince George refinery, which would also have renewable hydrogen components although there is more work to be done, he said.
MacLeod emphasized that Tidewater won't be stepping into a massive capital project that's not contracted and wouldn't have a fairly high rate of return. “But when we have government support, it's getting quite interesting, especially with Prince George having the highest diesel prices in in North America and also being the only province with LCFS [low carbon fuel standard] compliance costs/credits,” he said.
Tidewater also has heard from parties who would like to help fund the project if it didn’t want to commit material funds to the project, according to MacLeod. 
In addition, the company has had numerous parties approach it on hydrogen and various hydrogen opportunities given that Tidewater already has three operating hydrogen assets in Prince George today, he said. “We also have a material number of operating carbon capture assets that are likely to benefit from the growing hydrogen and renewable energy push that continues globally.”
Pipestone
At the Pipestone sour gas plant, Tidewater processed an average volume of 72 mmcf/d in the third quarter of 2020. Facility availability for the quarter averaged 78 per cent due to a constraint in early July that was offset by record throughput in September of 86 mmcf/d and over 90 per cent availability.
The plant is fully contracted with more than 80 per cent committed on take or pay arrangements.
 Subsequent to the third quarter, Tidewater and its partner, TransAlta Corporation, entered into an updated purchase and sale agreement with ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. to sell the Pioneer Pipeline to ATCO for gross proceeds of $255 million under substantially similar terms to the previously announced transaction with NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL).
Regulatory approval is anticipated in the first quarter of 2021 and Tidewater said it remains proactive in its efforts to accelerate the timeline. Closing of the transaction will occur within 10 days of receipt of regulatory approval.
Brazeau River complex
Throughput at the Brazeau River gas processing facility for the third quarter of 2020 was in line with the previous quarter. Overall supply volumes at the fractionation facility increased by approximately 1,000 bbls/day in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter largely driven by increased truck-in supply and stronger NGL pricing.
Due to the recent improvement in AECO gas prices, Tidewater said it continues to see increased activity in the Deep Basin area near the BRC, which has led to the tie-in of additional raw gas volumes from a mid-sized producer which came online in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Tidewater and NGTL have agreed to terms and conditions to qualify Tidewater to receive interruptible storage services (IT-S service) at its Brazeau River Complex storage facilities. With the IT-S service, Tidewater will be able to attract new, creditworthy storage customers at the facilities, creating expansion opportunities to increase storage capacities.
Subject to regulatory approvals, Tidewater and NGTL have also agreed to terms and conditions to qualify Tidewater for NGTL services with respect to the natural gas currently transported on the Pioneer Pipeline and incremental natural gas from increased access to the NGTL System, which will lead to higher fractionation and processing utilization levels at the BRC.
Natural gas storage
Fair levels of market volatility in the third quarter allowed its natural gas storage assets to perform well, said Tidewater. Operationally, all facilities performed well, with Pipestone gas storage facilities once again demonstrating daily injection rates in excess of forecasts in its first injection season following the 2019 expansion.
Capital program 
Tidewater has not committed to a significant capital program in 2021 although it continues to evaluate smaller capital projects ($20 million to $30 million) with a two-year to two-and-a-half-year payout range, said MacLeod.  
Following the 2019 commissioning of three of the largest capital projects in its history, Tidewater’s top priorities remain free cash flow generation and debt reduction, said the company. It remains committed to reducing leverage throughout 2020 and 2021 with a target of three times to 3.5 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA upon closing of the Pioneer transaction.
COVID-19 Update
Operating conditions have greatly improved from the second quarter, but there are still uncertainties around the pandemic and the economic recovery, said Tidewater which continues to operate safely and reliably with its facilities continuing to remain fully operational. It also has begun returning its workforce to its business offices and continues to assess its pace of re-entry depending on guidance from health and government officials.

Future Of Dakota Access Pipeline Uncertain As Biden Presidency Looms | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– The election of Democrat Joe Biden could create more headaches for the Dakota Access Pipeline’s (DAPL) owners, who are already embroiled in legal battles to keep the main conduit for flowing oil out of North Dakota running.
The $3.8 billion DAPL ships about 40 per cent of the crude oil produced from the Bakken shale region in North Dakota to refiners in the Midwest and exporters in the U.S. Gulf. Without the 557,000-bbl/d line, getting oil out of the area, which has about one million bbls/d of output, would be much more difficult left to smaller existing pipelines and rail.
DAPL’s controlling owner, Dallas-based Energy Transfer LP, is fighting to keep the pipeline running after a judge threw out its permit to run the line under a South Dakota lake that is a water source for Native American tribes that want the pipeline shut.
DAPL was a controversial project that sparked massive demonstrations starting in 2016 in North Dakota by native tribes and climate activists opposed to its completion.
President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, blocked a permit that would have allowed construction under South Dakota's Lake Oahe, a critical water source for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
The line was finished in 2017 after Trump, upon taking office, approved a final permit allowing construction under the lake to be completed.
In July, a U.S. district court judge threw out that permit, and ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a new environmental review that is expected to take months.
Biden, who defeated incumbent Trump in last week’s election, could bring in new Army Corps leadership. That could increase the chances that the line would be shut. For now, the Corps has allowed DAPL to operate on federal land without a permit.
The Biden transition team did not comment on their position.
Executives at Energy Transfer do not expect the line to be shut.
""We really don't envision or see a scenario where we will take the pipeline out of service,"" Energy Transfer president and chief commercial officer Marshall McCrea said on a quarterly earnings call with investors on Nov. 4, a day after the election. ""We just don't think that's going to happen.""
Regulators last month approved a plan to double the pipeline's capacity.
Dakota Access is appealing the rulings by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordering an environmental review and vacating the permit. Meanwhile, the district court is considering an injunction to shut the line while the review is carried out.
""If the court issues a shutdown order before Biden's inauguration, it would significantly increase the odds that his administration kills the project permanently, though he would retain the ability to do so even without such an order,"" said Glenn Schwartz, director of the energy policy service at Washington D.C.-based consultancy Rapidan Energy Group.
The district court is expected to decide in the next couple of months on the shutdown order sought by opponents of the line.
""This is a major crude oil pipeline crossing unceded tribal land and affecting the water supply for millions of people,"" said Jan Hasselman, an Earthjustice attorney who represents the Standing Rock Sioux.

Enbridge Line 3 Receives MPCA Approvals And Remaining DNR Permits | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency announced approvals for Enbridge Inc.'s Line 3 project, including the 401 Water Quality Certification. 
Also, today the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources released the final eight permits for the project.
""Clearly this is a big day for Line 3 in Minnesota,"" said Leo Golden vice-president of Line 3 execution. ""These authorizations and approvals are an important step towards construction for this safety and maintenance focused replacement project which comes at an important time for Minnesota.""
This decision from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, including the project's 401 Water Quality Certification clears the way for a determination from the US Army Corps of Engineers regarding federal permits.
The Line 3 project has been designed to avoid and minimize impacts to sensitive streams and wetlands.  Enbridge pipelines have coexisted with the nation's most productive wild rice waters for 70 years, said the company.
The authorizations and permits approved today by the Minnesota DNR range from a license for utility crossing of state land and public water, to water appropriation for dust control, hydrostatic testing and horizontal directional drilling.  Enbridge has now received all 10 of the DNR permits and authorizations for the safety and maintenance focused Line 3 replacement project.  The project still needs final permits and authorizations before construction can begin. 
“The thorough, robust, science-based review of the project over the past six years has led to evidence-based approvals. Enbridge recognizes that the permit conditions required by the PCA and DNR are essential for protecting Minnesota's sensitive streams and wild rice waters during construction and planning for post-construction restoration and enhancement,” said the company.
Enbridge implemented an effective COVID-19 testing and screening program that has proven effective during its recent Line 3 construction in North Dakota, it said. 
“We will continue to follow the latest guidance provided by local, federal and international public-health and government authorities to protect workers and communities.
“The project will provide significant economic benefits for counties, small businesses, Native American communities, and union members. Line 3 is a shovel-ready, $2.6-billion private investment that will bring 4,200 family-sustaining construction jobs, millions of dollars in local spending and tax revenues at a time when Northern Minnesota needs it most.”

"Still Hope For Keystone XL, Says Mar | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Although United States president-elect Joe Biden has said he will cancel the presidential permit for TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL pipeline, that isn’t necessarily a done deal, a Canada West Foundation session on what the U.S. election means for Canada heard Tuesday.
“There’s a lot of different scenarios where Keystone may or not be approved,” said Gary Mar, the foundation’s president and chief executive officer who served as Alberta’s representative in Washington, D.C. during the Barack Obama presidency.
 Although there are significant differences between today and five years ago when Obama cancelled the permit, a continued Republican majority in the Senate might be the most helpful in allowing the project to continue, Mar suggested. 
“Overall, Joe Biden has demonstrated himself to be largely a centrist moderate voice within the Senate for over four decades,” he said. “The president-elect has many, many friends in the Senate, and he has had a history of working bilaterally, across the aisle.”
Mar said he expects Biden to negotiate with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and come to an agreement in order to achieve some Democratic demands. “He could actually sort of blame a Republican Senate for why he can't move forward on his interest in turning down the Keystone XL pipeline.”
Major differences from five years ago include recent commitments from major Canadian producers to net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, said Mar.
Asked by moderator Deb Yedlin, a Canada West board member, if it could be argued that Canadian energy players have an advantage over their U.S. counterparts because of the Canadians’ ESG (environment, social and governance), Mar said he thinks “that's a positive message for us to be able to deliver.” And that’s “over and above the general sort of security issues relating to energy in the United States.”
The U.S., he noted, has become more dependent on Canadian crude imports as Gulf Coast refineries contend with reduced supplies of Venezuelan and Mexican heavy crudes, he said.
In addition, “you've got a president who really needs to focus on jobs as he tries to work on a domestic set of policies to make sure that there are jobs and economic opportunities,” said Mar. “You've got labour unions that supported Mr. Biden during the election campaign. And those contracts are now signed up for work to be done.”
Asked whether Canadian federal and provincial governments should be shifting the conversation towards collaboration with the U.S. on energy and climate change, Mar said it’s clear that Biden wants to move forward on the U.S. rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.
 “I think it would be very good to have a partner to go with to talk about North American energy competitiveness,” he said.
“We should not underestimate the importance of the good relationship that the Prime Minister of Canada appears to have with Mr. Biden,” added Mar.
“And I think it would be part of a broader narrative that we should be looking at: what did he campaign on? What is it that he wants to accomplish? And how do we fit within that narrative?” he said. “That strikes me as being smart public policy on the part of the Canadian and provincial governments.”
Mar said he doesn’t believe that a Biden administration would impose carbon offset duties on imported oil.
“By doing that, I'm not sure that he would be doing the United States a big favour in this regard,” he said. “They're still looking for affordable, reliable energy to be able to sort of reset their economy.”
The economic recovery is second only to the COVID-19 response on the Biden administration’s “need to do list” and “I don't think that putting in carbon taxes on incoming energy is the way that he would be doing that.”
Mar also downplayed the potential influence on a Biden administration of the Green New Deal faction of the Democratic Party while emphasizing that Kamala Harris, Biden’s vice-president and a Green New Deal supporter should not be underestimated. “But the manner in which people campaign is sometimes different from the reality in which they are able to govern,” he said.
There also are elected people within the Democratic Party who don't share the more progressive views of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), according to Mar. “So, you can campaign on that, but the reality of governing may quickly set in, and I think it'll be very important to recognize that 70 million people voted for [outgoing President] Donald Trump.”
He suggested that Biden will have to be especially gracious and will have to work hard with those who felt that Trump represented their interests and they had been ignored by Democrats in the past.  “And to me, he's really got to focus on jobs. He's got to focus on hard hats,” said Mar. “He's got to focus on those things which in the next four years will create jobs in the United States.”
“That's not to say that the environment is not important in his agenda — it is,” said Mar. “But so many of the things that we're doing here in Western Canada — for example hydrogen — fit very neatly within the overall framework of the direction that the Biden administration seems to be going.”

Gattinger: Canada Needs To Think Differently About Bilateral Energy Relations | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"

McConaghy: A Probable Biden Presidency – Truth and Consequences
Lauerman: Feds Must Invest Big In Alberta’s Clean Energy Future
Lauerman: Blue Hydrogen Better Bet For Alberta Than Petchems

After a tense few days, Democrat Joe Biden has been declared president-elect of the United States. While the results will no doubt be contested by President Donald Trump in the weeks and months to come, it seems clear that Biden is headed for the White House.
What will a Biden presidency mean for Canadian energy? What bilateral objectives should governments pursue?
A Biden administration represents both opportunities and challenges for Canadian energy, but to be successful in its relations with Washington, Canada needs to think differently about how it approaches the U.S.
Over the last two decades, relations between Canadian and American federal governments over energy have died a slow death. Gone are the days when the U.S. looked to Canada as a pivotal energy supplier and crucial pillar of national energy security. Likewise, gone are the days when the two countries pointed to Canada-U.S. energy relations as a shining example of bilateral relations at their finest. 
What happened? In two words: shale and climate.
The shale revolution transformed the U.S. from hydrocarbon poor to hydrocarbon rich, and energy security dropped off the U.S. policy agenda. This has steadily chipped away at Canada’s ability to get Washington’s attention.
In the early 2000s, concerns over U.S. energy security reached a high point. The 1980s and 1990s saw American dependence on foreign oil and gas climb, and there were grave concerns about pending natural gas shortages in North America. Energy security was a top policy priority for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Strengthening relations with Canada figured prominently in their thinking. It’s hard to fathom now, but fully one-third of the one hundred and fifty recommendations in the 2001 Bush-Cheney National Energy Policy mentioned Canada.
Fast-forward 20 years and the U.S. is now the largest oil and gas producer in the world. Technological developments enabled the profitable production of tight oil and shale gas. Between 2008 and 2018, proved oil reserves in the U.S. doubled to 44 billion bbls. Proved gas reserves more than doubled to 505 trillion cubic feet (tcf). Production climbed at a remarkable clip: between 2005 and 2019, U.S. oil production jumped from five million bbls/d to over 12 million, handily exceeding the 10 million per day production peak of the early 1970s. Gas production likewise skyrocketed from 18 trillion cubic feet in 2005 to 34 in 2019. The U.S. became a net gas exporter in 2017 — the first time since the 1950s. Looking forward, recent declines in investment in the U.S. are not likely indicative of major production declines — especially not in the long term.
American production growth has had a major impact on imports. U.S. oil imports declined from 13.7 million bbls/d in 2005 to 9.1 in 2019, with most of the decline edging out OPEC producers. Canadian petroleum exports to the U.S. doubled in this period from 2.2 to 4.4 million bbls/d. Canada represented about half of U.S. oil imports in 2019. But discounts between the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select, low prices for WTI and a lack of adequate reliable access to U.S. markets have challenged producers in Canada. In natural gas, imports to the U.S. from Canada are down from 3.7 tcf in 2005 to 2.7 tcf in 2019 and floor gas prices in North America make LNG exports to markets beyond the U.S. a compelling alternative.
U.S. imports of electricity from Canada are also down in recent years, as fuel switching to cheap natural gas, increasingly low-cost wind and solar generation, and barriers to electricity trade reduce power imports. This has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. power sector.
Which brings us to climate.
Climate change was on policy agendas well before the 2000s, but in the last 20 years it has taken on unprecedented prominence and salience. Successive Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports documenting rapid changes in the global climate, the emergence of well organized and financed campaigns lobbying governments to take climate action and the continued climb in global GHG emissions have all combined to make climate an overriding energy policy and political imperative in the U.S.
Climate policy has mainly been the preserve of the Democratic Party — think former Vice President Al Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth, President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or more recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. But even for administrations that pay less attention — even no attention — to climate policy, climate change is an incontournable with lots of traction in American politics. The fact that President Trump’s commitment to the Keystone XL pipeline did little to move the yardsticks on the project is a case in point.
Concerns over climate have changed U.S. views about Canada. Canadian energy — notably oil from the oilsands —  has gone from being a source of enthusiastic U.S. interest to a source of concern or ambivalence, even outright disdain. U.S. environmental campaigns against the ‘tar sands,’ American policies and pronouncements — including by President Obama —  against so-called ‘dirty oil’ and widespread opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, the poster child for anti-oilsands sentiment, are all emblematic of this shift.
Both of these changes have had a major impact on Canada-U.S. energy relations: the need for the White House to collaborate with Canada on energy has withered. Security of supply has evaporated from the U.S. policy agenda —  the U.S. no longer has a desperate need for Canadian product. And climate politics make fossil fuels a polarizing aspect of American energy policy. Trips to Washington to extol the virtues of Canadian oil and gas risk falling on deaf ears. Instead, for the Democratic Party, it is easier —  if not outright desirable —  to prohibit a pipeline that’s become a potent symbol in partisan polarized debates over energy and climate.
So how should Canadian governments approach the U.S. on energy?

Lack Of Regulations And Incentives Holding Geothermal Back

They need to think about things differently. This is not about a sales pitch for product. It’s about an invitation to collaborate on shared energy and environmental policy priorities in the long term.
Canada and the United States have the largest interconnected and interdependent energy system in the world. They are also among the largest hydrocarbon reserve holders and are both major energy producers. Both countries are also federations in which subnational governments possess substantial energy powers. In addition, with Joe Biden in the White House, they both have ambitious commitments on climate. But energy and climate debates are divisive if not outright polarized in both countries. For Canada and the U.S., perhaps more than for any other two countries in the world, figuring out how to successfully chart their energy futures in an age of climate change is essential, but fraught.
And therein lies the opportunity: collaborating on the grand energy and climate challenges for the short and long term benefit of both countries. It’s about making the case that Canada and the United States stand a better chance of meeting the energy and environmental challenges of the years ahead if they collaborate, not compete or go it alone.
A Biden presidency represents opportunity for Canada. Biden is a moderate Democrat, more prone to be pragmatic than dogmatic. While much was made of his fumbled remarks on oil and gas in the last presidential debate, he walked them back in short order and made clear on the campaign trail that he would not ban fracking.
A close look at the Democratic Party’s campaign commitments on energy and climate suggests a Biden presidency might be open to this sort of collaboration. Biden committed to bring the U.S. back into the Paris agreement and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This aligns with the government of Canada’s commitments on climate. Biden also committed to aggressively reducing the carbon intensity of the electricity sector, which also aligns with government policies in Canada.
More than anything, though, Biden’s commitments on energy and climate signal an ‘all of the above’ approach, defining ‘clean energy’ in an inclusive way that extends well beyond a narrow focus on wind and solar energy, to include support for carbon capture, utilization and storage, small modular nuclear reactors and methane reductions. Collaborating on these issues, which are also priorities for Canada, would advance both countries’ energy and climate objectives.
A shared Canada-U.S. approach should not only encompass energy at home, but also energy abroad. Oil and gas will remain a major staple in global energy markets in the decades ahead, but increasingly, it will have to be cost and carbon competitive. Canada and the U.S. could work together to reduce the carbon content of their oil and gas exports, whether through methane management, CCUS or next generation products like hydrogen. And with the U.S. back in the Paris Accord, they could work together internationally on mechanisms to obtain carbon credits where exports displace higher emitting energy in other countries.
But none of this will be easy. The two countries won’t agree on everything. The most obvious example is Keystone. The Biden campaign committed to quashing the presidential permit for the pipeline, a move that would be consistent with the Obama administration’s opposition to the project. Prime Minister Trudeau and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney have committed to working together to avoid this outcome. Given the symbolism of Keystone, however, they are likely to face an uphill battle. A Biden presidency would have more political capital to lose than gain by reversing this position.
Instead of making Keystone the centrepiece of Canadian bilateral energy relations, governments would do better to make it part of a broader engagement, one that approaches the White House with a long term vision of how the two countries could work together to mutual benefit. A proposal to partner, not a sales pitch. This could even pave the way for Biden support for Keystone — and for the Alberta government to secure a return on its investment in the project.
A broader discussion of energy would help to raise U.S. awareness of environmental, social and governance performance and gains in Canadian energy, including emissions reductions in the oilsands, clean LNG and clean power. Reframing bilateral energy relations would put focus on the ability for collaboration to deliver stronger economic, environmental and security performance in both countries. Given that president-elect Biden will have a hard time getting the legislation and budget he wants from Republicans in Congress, collaboration with Canada could give the administration an attractive platform for progress on energy and climate. For Canada, it would help to further long term trade, environmental, security and fiscal objectives. 
All of this hinges on Canadian governments being willing to refresh their thinking on bilateral energy relations. If there ever was a time, it is now.

Enbridge CEO Sees Long-Term Global Demand For Natural Gas | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Natural gas will dominate global energy as conventional energy will be needed for a long time to come, says the chief executive of Enbridge Inc.  
“Some people call this [gas] the bridge but it's going to be, in our view, an awfully long bridge,” Al Monaco, president and chief executive officer, said Friday in an energy outlook during a conference call to discuss third quarter 2020 results. “That’s simply because gas is abundant, low cost, has excellent storability, lower emissions and it's crucial to renewables intermittency.”
Enbridge expects roughly 40 tcf/year of new industrial and power generation demand as alternatives are limited for   industrial use, he said. While RNG [renewable natural gas] is “going to be real,” it’s unlikely to come into play in a material way before 2040, analysts were told. “And of course, renewables are going to continue to grow as it's clear they are competitive.”
According to Monaco, Enbridge is well positioned in terms of the resiliency and longevity of its cash flow from gas transmission, gas distribution and storage and liquids pipelines for what it believes will be a gradual energy transition. It also has optimized the business by “grinding out costs” and selling assets that didn't fit, simplifying the structure and bolstering its financial position.
The company, he said, also has taken a gradual, disciplined approach to the energy transition, including the diversification into natural gas and renewables and now is looking at opportunities in renewable natural gas (RNG) from organic landfill waste, hydrogen power-to-gas and hydrogen blending.
 “That approach [to the energy transition] really comes down to two things: aligning our asset mix to long term fundamentals and creating what we call low cost, ‘no regret’ options that position us for the future in a way that doesn't mess with our low risk business.”
Enbridge built its first onshore wind project two decades ago and it was a “no regret move” because it came with a long term PPA (power purchase agreement) that ensured a good return, said Monaco. “That one initial option allowed us to learn the business and after many other projects led to our first offshore wind project in Europe.”
It currently has1,800 net megawatts of capacity of wind and solar production in North America and offshore Europe and the plan is to continue to grow the business as it has in the past “organically at a reasonable pace,” he said.
“We've applied exactly the same approach to RNG and hydrogen, which is why we're ahead of the curve on those two.”
RNG represents an opportunity to grow gas volumes, and leverage its own utility and GTN (Gas Transmission Northwest) franchises, said Monaco. Enbridge has six research and development projects operating and in construction with more planned in the upgrading and injection end of the RNG value chain. “All are either included in rate base, or have long term contracts so they fit the overall business.”
Hydrogen also offers another good long-term opportunity for Enbridge to capitalize on its infrastructure although the company believes the economics for blue and green hydrogen are challenged right now, he said. “But support will increase and costs are bound to come down.”
Enbridge has piloted North America's first power-to-gas facility which uses an electrolyzer to convert water to hydrogen. The plant is contracted to provide grid stability for the ISO (independent service operator) to capture off-peak renewable power, and the company has just received approval for the second phase to blend hydrogen into the gas stream, which lowers carbon intensity and is used for storage and re-electrification, said Monaco.
“Related to that is a potentially large application of hydrogen, which is blending in the gas stream all across our transmission network, so an excellent marriage here between new technology and our existing infrastructure.”
Enbridge is “ahead of the curve” on some of the good long-term opportunities where technology has already been proven out and is doing it in a way that aligns with the pace of transition that it sees, he suggested.
Global energy forecast
In the meantime, though, “global energy demand will rise in the next two decades driven by population growth and an increase in middle class and urbanization,” said Monaco. “Developing countries by themselves will need at least 35 per cent more energy and we think North America has a great opportunity to increase global market share supply, simply because we have the best resources, technology, infrastructure, and environmental standards.”
The return of economic growth also will depend on affordable and reliable energy, he said. “That's always been the case over history and won't change.”
“And third, no matter what the future demand looks like, what kind of energy we're talking about, we need existing infrastructure, replacements and new build,” said Monaco.
Recent new forecasts to 2040 generally show a growth in energy demand, with a slight shift in supply mix as coal declines and oil and gas production increases, continuing to make up more than half the mix, said the Enbridge CEO. Renewables will move at a “fast clip” from a low base. “We're going to need all sources of supply of energy to meet demand to at least 2040 and very likely beyond.”
 Demand and supply mix, though, could look markedly different if there is a faster transition, said Monaco. For example, assuming all announced policies to lower emission are implemented as scheduled, new infrastructure spending nearly doubles to $35 trillion, 150 gigawatts a year of solar capacity is added compared to 85 gigawatts per year today, and electric vehicles adoption increases to 15 per cent of the global fleet, up from one per cent in 2020.
“Now everybody's motivated to see this happen but it's not going to be a cakewalk by any means and without these actions, consumption of energy is very likely to be higher and the mix change a lot slower,” he said.
“A more radical change in consumption is possible, but not by 2040, in our view,” said Monaco. “For example, we need more aggressive and globally synchronized policy and significant carbon prices.”
ESG
Enbridge also is confident it will be able to achieve an interim emissions intensity reduction target of 35 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050 as part of its new ESG targets as those efforts already are underway, he said.
Those pathways include modernizing equipment and applying technology to tackle emissions and reduce consumption, using lower carbon sources of fuel for pumps and compressors and solar self-powering of electric pump and compressor stations along its liquids and gas pipelines. 
 “This won't take a lot of capital investment, just given the nature of those pathways but any time we do make an investment, it'll be subject to the usual investment criteria we have for any opportunity,” said Monaco.

Enbridge Solar Power Facility Will Help Power Canadian Mainline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Construction is underway on Alberta Solar One (ABS1), Enbridge Inc.’s first solar generation facility in southern Alberta, halfway between Lethbridge and Medicine Hat.
The $20 million, 10.5-megawatt facility will supply a portion of the power requirements for the company’s Canadian Mainline pipeline operations with renewable power. Once in operation, the facility will supply the equivalent to the energy needs of about 3,000 homes, offsetting about 12,000 tonnes of carbon annually.
Facilities are expected to be in operation by April 2021.
ABS1 was co-developed by Enbridge and Morgan Solar, a Toronto-based solar technology company. In addition to advancing Enbridge’s pipeline greening initiative, the project will also help to commercialize Morgan Solar’s SimbaX technology.
The Enbridge facility will be the first utility scale application of SimbaX, an optical film that when applied to a standard PV solar panel concentrates light in order to boost its energy production.
ABS1 is part of a broad solar-self power initiative Enbridge is undertaking. It currently is pursuing opportunities to co-locate solar facilities adjacent to its pipeline operations across the United States Midwest and Canada.
The company also has completed construction on a 2.4-megawatt solar self-power facility adjacent to the Lambertville natural gas compressor station in New Jersey. It also is in the process of finalizing plans for a second solar self-power project in the U.S. and three other sites currently are undergoing a feasibility study.

Pembina Sees Opportunities From Industry Consolidations | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Pembina Pipeline Corporation generally benefits from upstream consolidations such as Tourmaline Oil Corp.’s recent-announced acquisition of Jupiter Resources Ltd. and Modern Resources Inc., says Pembina’s top brass.
“In the depths of March and April, investors were worried about some of the weaker players out there, and they’re starting to be consolidated and become stronger players,” Michael Dilger, president and chief executive officer, told this morning’s Q3 conference call.
He said the Tourmaline deal, for example, sees two weaker Pembina customers consolidate with an industry leader, which helps with customers’ capabilities during difficult times in the energy sector. “We welcome it. We think it’s good for the areas in which we operate, and it’s good for credit.”
Regarding midstream consolidations, the CEO noted that his company has been a consolidator in North American over the years, but in Canada it is somewhat rare. “I expect in the U.S. to see much more consolidation than in Canada. I think Canada on average has much greater balance-sheet strengths than what we see in the U.S.”
Pembina management anticipates numerous upcoming opportunities as 2021 approaches, for example, as it keeps advancing engineering work and optimize scope on the still-deferred Phase VII Peace Pipeline expansion.
“Looking ahead, we see positive signs,” Dilger told the conference call. “Consolidation amongst Canadian energy companies is beginning to occur, and that will strengthen our customer base. We are hopeful an effective COVID-19 vaccine will be broadly available in 2021, and we expect a balancing of oil supply and demand by 2022, and all that those statements entail.”
Further options to allocate capital include funding a growing backlog of other uncommitted growth projects, debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders. Pembina will provide a “fulsome business update” early next month, which includes updates on deferred capital projects, a 2021 outlook, as well as capital budget and funding plan.
Volumes are stable
Pembina moved 3.45 million and 3.46 million boe/d on its pipelines during the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared with 3.44 million and 3.41 million boe/d during the same periods last year.
“On a physical basis, activity levels have stabilized and are beginning to improve,” said Scott Burrows, senior vice-president and chief financial officer. “Pembina’s conventional pipeline business, physical volumes in July and August, were consistent with levels seen in the end of the second quarter of this year, or roughly eight per cent below first quarter levels, and well above the lows experienced in April and early May.”
He added: “We saw physical volumes decline in September, which is due to operators electing to perform routine maintenance and turnaround activities, which is typical in the third quarter, as well as extended, unplanned outages at third-party facilities.”
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in Q3 and the first nine months of 2020 was $796 million and $2.42 billion, respectively, which is eight and six per cent more than during the same 2019 periods. According to this week’s Q3 financial and operational results, contributions from new assets following the Kinder Morgan Canada Limited acquisition positively impacted the quarterly results, as reflected in EBTIDA.
Management continues to expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA to be within Pembina’s original guidance range set in Q4 2019, albeit near the lower end of that range. Based on the current outlook for the rest of this year, the company has narrowed its guidance range and expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of between $3.25 billion and $3.30 billion.
Revenue and earnings in Q3
During the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, the company’s revenue totalled $1.57 billion and $4.51 billion, respectively, which is down eight and 18 per cent from the same periods last year. Earnings for third quarter and first three quarters of this year were $318 million and $885 million, respectively, compared to $370 million and $1.35 billion during the same 2019 timeframes.
Lower margins on crude oil and NGL sales in the quarter as a result of COVID-19 impacts on market conditions reducing crude activities, in addition to lower frac spreads hindering NGL margins, impacted Pembina’s marketing and new ventures segment. General and administrative expense net of other income decreased due to lower incentive costs.
Meanwhile, marketed NGL volumes of 169,000 boe/d in Q3 2020 represent a four-per-cent decrease compared to the same period last year. Volumes for the third quarter fell as Pembina proactively increased NGL storage positions with plans to monetize during the upcoming winter season, which increased Aux Sable volumes partially offset.
Capital expenditures totalled $174 million and $868 million in Q3 and the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2020, respectively, which is down 59 and 29 per cent from the same periods last year.
Operations update
Subsequent to Q3, Pembina completed start-up of new fractionation and terminalling facilities at the Empress NGL extraction facility, which add about 30,000 bbls/d of propane-plus fractionation capacity, letting Pembina optimize its propane marketing from the facility between eastern and western markets.
Meanwhile, Pembina continues to improve on Duvernay III, which includes a 100 mmcf/d sweet gas, shallow cut processing train, 20,000 bbls/d of inlet condensate stabilization, as well as other associated infrastructure. Construction is substantially complete and commissioning work is currently progressing as planned. Capital budget is $200 million for this project, which is trending under budget with an expected Q4 2020 in-service date.
Crews continue developing Pembina’s 25,000 bb/d Prince Rupert Terminal, which will mostly source propane from the Redwater Complex. All site construction activities temporarily halted due to COVID-19 have restarted. The project has a $250 million capital budget and is trending over budget with an expected in-service date in Q1 2021.
Further, work continues on the Hythe Developments project in which Pembina and its 45-per-cent owned joint venture, Veresen Midstream, are constructing natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure in the Pipestone Montney region. Construction is nearly complete. The capital budget for the project is $240 million, net to Pembina, with an anticipated in-service date of late 2020.
“We continue to assemble a multi-year inventory of development opportunities,” said Burrows. “The scale, breadth and diversification of our business inherently affords us a strong suite of greenfield/brownfield optimization and new market development opportunities. These opportunities range in size from $100 million to several billion dollars.”
He added: “We will exit 2020 in a strong financial position with the ability to fund the next wave of future growth, pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders.”
Dividend declared
Pembina’s board of directors this week declared a common share cash dividend for November 2020 of 21 cents per share to be paid, subject to applicable law, on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record on Nov. 25. This dividend is designated an “eligible dividend” for Canadian income tax purposes.

Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Water Permit Decision Expected By Nov. 14 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc. continues to advance its Line 3 replacement project in Minnesota with a decision by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) on its Water Quality Certificate expected by the Nov. 14 statutory deadline.
The contested case hearing concluded with a positive recommendation from the administrative law judge (ALJ), Al Monaco, Enbridge president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call to discuss third quarter 2020 results. “That's important because it clears the way for the PCA 401 permit decision by next week’s statutory deadline and the Army Corps 404 [permit].”
At this point, Enbridge has all its federal permits with the exception of the Army Corps permit, which is well underway and near the final stages of being issued,” he said. “So, once we get the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for one permit, our expectation is to get the Army Corps permit relatively quickly.”
Construction is expected to take six to nine months once all permits are in place.
While heavy crude capacity on the Enbridge Mainline has been heavily apportioned since July due to strong demand, the company expects to ramp up medium capacity in the first and second quarters of 2021 with increased medium blends to optimize utilization of the light lines, said Monaco.
Fourth quarter 2020 throughput should be in the range of 2.55 million bbls/d to 2.75 million bbls/d, accounting for second wave impacts of COVID-19 and 2.65 million bbls/d to 2.75 million bbls/d in the first quarter of 2021.
In the third quarter of 2020, Mainline volumes ex-Gretna averaged 2.555 million bbls/d, down from 2.714 million bbls/d in the 2019 quarter.  Nine-month throughput averaged 2.612 million bbls/d versus 2.698 million bbls/d in 2019.
Monaco also announced that Enbridge has set new ESG targets to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 to reduce its emissions intensity by 35 per cent by 2035, covering scope one and two emissions. And although the midstream business today accounts for about two per cent of the energy value chain, Enbridge will be tracking performance.
 “ESG has been part of how we've operated this business for a very long time,” he said. “We've set and met targets in the past and the way we look at ESG is really as an enabler of our operations and our ability to execute strategy — so not a nice to have, but a must do.”
The company also will be increasing its diversity goals on gender representation and ethnic and racial groups at the company and board levels and will link that to executive compensation.
Enbridge posted GAAP earnings attributable to common shareholders of $990 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2020 (2019-$949 million) and $1.21 billion (2019-$4.58 billion) for the nine months.
Adjusted EBITDA declined to $3 billion from $3.11 billion in the 2019 quarter. The business benefited from incremental earnings from a positive rate settlement on Texas Eastern, contributions from new assets that were placed into service in late 2019 and the first half of 2020 and customer growth and synergy realizations in Gas Distribution and Storage.
This was more than offset by lower contributions from Energy Services due in part to lower Mainline throughput related to COVID-19, lower Energy Services and the absence of contributions from the federally regulated Canadian natural gas gathering and processing business sold on Dec. 31, 2019.
Nine month adjusted EBITDA was $10.07 billion (2019-$10.09 billion.)
Adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2020 decreased to $961 million from $1.12 billion, primarily driven by lower adjusted EBITDA as well as a reduction in capitalized interest and higher depreciation from new assets placed into service throughout 2019, primarily on the Canadian Line 3 replacement program.
Distributable cash flow declined to $2.09 billion from $2.11 billion for the quarter but rose to $7.23 billion from $7.17 billion for the nine months.
On a segment basis, adjusted EBITDA for Liquids Pipelines declined to $1.73 billion (2019-$1.83 billion) for the quarter, due in part to lower Mainline volumes due to COVID-19.
Mainline adjusted EBITDA was $994 million (2019-$1.03 billion) for the quarter and $3.07 billion ($2.94 billion) for the nine months.
Gulf Coast and Midcontinent System was $213 million (2019-$227 million) and $714 million (2019-$708 million) for the three and nine months respectively.

"Alberta Auditor Flags $1.6B In Government Accounting Blunders, Oversight Problems | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(The Canadian Press) –– Alberta's auditor general has flagged $1.6 billion worth of accounting blunders along with oversight issues by Premier Jason Kenney's government on big-ticket files including the Keystone XL pipeline and the so-called energy war room.
Auditor general Doug Wylie says the errors have been or are being corrected by the United Conservative government. But he highlights the importance of adhering to accounting principles so people have an accurate picture of what's going on.
“The overarching theme of this report is to ensure the importance of having good, sound, strong financial control processes in place, and then beyond that ensuring that you are following them,'' Wylie said Thursday before delivering his fall report to the legislature.
“It's extremely important to ensure that that happens in times of [fiscal] restraint, when you are looking at various control processes and streamlining.''
Wylie's findings revolve mainly around the energy portfolio.
The government has been selling off contracts to move oil by rail. The transportation plan was brought in by the previous NDP government, but the UCP deemed it ineffective and began off-loading 19 contracts to the private sector.
Wylie said the government at fiscal year end on March 31 treated those contracts as being off-loaded for accounting purposes, even though less than half of the deals were completed, forcing a $637-million adjustment to expenses.
He noted the government also had to make a $100-million adjustment to its Keystone XL pipeline investment. The government made that investment before fiscal year end, he said, but the money wasn't reflected in the proper balance sheet.
Wylie also said the government failed to update its cash flow model for the Sturgeon refinery after prices cratered earlier this year due to COVID-19 and a global oil price war, leading to a recommended $795-million adjustment to expenses.
There was $152 million added to costs for two income support programs, including Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped, after Community and Social Services recorded 11 months of those numbers instead of 12.
The auditor said the department has adjusted its numbers “to appropriately disclose that Community and Social Services exceeded its budgeted appropriation by $120 million.''
The auditor also criticized the Environment Department for muddled oversight on grants handed out under a $563-million fund that places a levy on heavy industrial greenhouse gas emitters. The auditor said there wasn't enough evidence to show that projects receiving fund money were in fact reducing emissions.
“For example, one of the grants was for dam maintenance, but we were not provided evidence to explain how the project reduced emissions or how it related to adaptation to climate change,'' stated Wylie's report.
He also said the Canadian Energy Centre, known as the energy war room, had not been properly documenting contracts with outside contactors and that some expenses were incurred without appropriate approvals.
The war room was created by Kenney in October 2019 with an annual budget of $30 million to fight perceived misinformation on Alberta's staple industry. Wylie said by fiscal year end, the centre had spent $1.3 million on outside contracts, primarily through sole sourcing.
Sole sourcing is a valid procurement method, he said, but organizations must retain documents to ensure there are no conflicts of interest and that taxpayers are getting value for their money.
Opposition NDP Leader Rachel Notley said the auditor's report is a harsh indictment of a government that claims to be fiscally responsible.
“This is potentially the worst audit of a government in generations,'' said Notley
“This government continually lectures Albertans that they are the only ones who can manage budgets.""
Notley renewed her call to shut down the Energy Centre.
She said issues cited by the auditor along with previous public relations gaffes, including use of someone else's copyrighted logo, should spell the end of a high-cost experiment she said is hurting Alberta's reputation rather than helping it.
“[Kenney] must just shut down this gong show, immediately,'' she said.
A spokesman for Energy Minister Sonya Savage, in a statement, did not address the auditor's criticism on broader energy accounting practices, but did speak to the war room.
“The board of directors of the Canadian Energy Centre are committed to ensuring that fiscal reporting is comprehensive and transparent,'' wrote Kavi Bal.
“The Canadian Energy Centre has improved its contract management process policies and aligned it with government best practice.'
The Energy Centre did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Kenney's government has seen its projected deficit this year soar to more than $24 billion from $6.8 billion due to collapsing oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Trans Mountain’s Coldwater Aquifer Report Complete Enough For Detailed Route Hearing, Says CER | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has unanimously determined that a Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC report on a condition of its expansion approval related to an aquifer underlying the Coldwater Indian Reserve No. 1 is complete enough to proceed to a detailed route hearing.
 “For clarity, this decision does not mean that the Condition 39 report has been found to satisfy the requirements of Condition 39, including appropriately quantifying the risks and determining appropriate mitigations,” the CER said in a letter decision.
The regulator also emphasized that it has not made any decision on the detailed route for the pipeline nor the most appropriate methods and timing of constructing the pipeline. These will be explored during the Phase 2 hearing that will allow for testing of the evidence and technical content.
The commission said that in reaching its decision on the completeness of the report, it considered the records of consultation done to date, the views of its predecessor, the National Energy Board, when it originally recommended approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, the federal cabinet’s approval of the project, and the comments of Coldwater, Natural Resources Canada and Trans Mountain regarding the completeness of the Condition 39 report.
The Phase 2 hearing will consider and decide on two issues: first, whether the proposed detailed route is the best possible route and whether its proposed methods and timing of construction are the most appropriate; and second, whether the Condition 39 report meets the requirements of Condition 39.
The NEB had imposed Condition 39 in response to the concerns raised by the Coldwater Indian Band regarding the project’s potential impacts on its aquifer. In its report reconsidering approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, it found that Trans Mountain had “not sufficiently substantiated in its evidence” that there are no potential interactions with the aquifer underlying the reserve and the proposed project route.
Condition 39 requires Trans Mountain to file a hydrogeological study to more precisely determine the potential for interactions and impacts on the aquifer at the reserve and to assess the need for any additional measures to protect the aquifer, including monitoring. The objective is to understand the hydrogeology in the area enough to be able to compare the risks of the various routes and consider possible mitigation measures to address identified risks.
The report is to be submitted at least six months prior to beginning construction of the project between Veale Road and Kingsvale Pump Station.
In comments filed with the commission, Coldwater argued that the Condition 39 report contains serious flaws and asked the commission to determine it incomplete for the purposes of proceeding to a detailed route hearing.
The First Nation submitted that without data from an exploratory drilling and geophysical program on the reserve, Trans Mountain does not have the information needed to develop reliable and defendable conclusions about the potential risks posed to the aquifer.
Trans Mountain maintained that on-reserve drilling is not a requirement of Condition 39 and to require it would not give the company control over when, or if, it is able to satisfy the condition and would not allow for compliance within a reasonable period of time.
While the on-reserve program is underway (although drilling has not yet started), Coldwater has insisted on sequential rather than simultaneous drilling, said Trans Mountain in its comments. This means that the drilling program will not be complete until the end of 2020 with associated information available in early 2021, assuming the drilling program unfolds as planned, it says.  “This would then be followed by the committed three-month route negotiation process and the commission’s regulatory processes, adding up to a very significant delay,” it said.
The commission said it earlier found that Condition 39 does not stipulate that monitoring wells are to be installed on the reserve. “Thus, while the additional on-reserve work might, for example, increase the precision of the exact extent of the aquifers and the direction and speed of groundwater, Condition 39 did not stipulate what level of precision was required,” it said.
The majority of the commission also disagreed with Coldwater’s submission that the additional on-reserve work is a pre-condition to fulfillment of the Crown’s constitutional obligations. The majority said that having reviewed the extensive evidence filed on the record, it concluded that Canada did not promise or commit to ensuring that Trans Mountain would complete on-reserve drilling.
“Were the NEB to demand a particular methodology that requires Coldwater’s co-operation, the condition would effectively give Coldwater a veto over the project,” said the commission. “Case law has consistently held that the duty to consult and accommodate Indigenous peoples should not have such effect.”
Trans Mountain last month filed an application to vary the alignment of the expansion project corridor in the Coldwater Valley area. If approved, it would result in the issuance of orders to amend the original certificate and related orders, to reflect the corridor realignment, the West Alternative Route.
The variance was filed partly in response to requests from Coldwater to re-route the corridor in a manner that avoids potential impacts to the aquifer beneath its reserve. The West Alternate Route realignment is approximately 18.36 kilometres in length, of which 14.3 kilometres parallels existing linear features.

"KAPS Construction To Begin In 2021, Says Keyera | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Keyera Corp. says it expects to invest between $400 million and $450 million in growth capital projects in 2021 with the majority focused on KAPS (Key Access Pipeline System) which it had deferred for a year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company expects to begin construction in 2021 and have the project to connect its gas plants in the Montney in northwest Alberta, to its NGL infrastructure in Fort Saskatchewan in operation in 2023, David Smith, outgoing chief executive officer, said in a conference call today to discuss third quarter 2020 results. The facility is 70 per cent contracted and all those contracts are still in place, added Dean Setoguchi, president and chief commercial officer, who will replace Smith Jan. 1, 2021.
Keyera recorded funds from operations of $190.91 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $227.4 million in the 2019 quarter with distributable cash flow of $174.86 million (2019-$183.81 million). Funds from operations for the nine months was $654.62 million (2019- $553.38 million) and distributable cash flow was $585.55 million (2019-$435.32 million).
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $196.16 million (2019-$268.93 million) and $705.44 million (2019 – $682.71 million) for the nine months.
Net earnings were $33.44 million (2019- $154.43 million) for the third quarter of 2020 and $136.81 million for the nine months (2019-$413.89 million). The results include impairment charges related to certain underutilized Keyera facilities.
Total capital spending was $154.43 million in the quarter and $$506.91 million for the nine months. In 2020, Keyera continues to expect to invest growth capital of between $500 million and $550 million, plus an additional $70 million for butane distribution infrastructure at Kinder Morgan’s Galena Park facility.
With a strong balance sheet and payout ratio of 54 per cent year to date, Keyera said it expects to continue to fund its growth capital projects without issuing common equity. It also plans to maintain its current monthly dividend of 16 cents per share or $1.92 per share annually.
Gathering and Processing
The Gathering and Processing segment reported operating margin of $49 million (Q3 2019 – $75 million) due to an unplanned outage at the Wapiti gas plant and lower gas processing volumes resulting from reduced producer activity, said Brad Lock, senior vice-president - Gathering and Processing.
 Net gathering and processing throughput was 953 mmcf/d net for the quarter (2019-1.41 bcf/d) and 1.03 bcf/d for the nine months (2019-1.19 bcf/d).
Keyera brought the Wapiti plant back online in late September and since then it has been operating very well and the company continues to take steps to improve the reliability of the facility, he said.  The financial impact of the outage was approximately $16 million, including repair costs and associated fee reductions provided to customers, said the company.
“Reliability and predictability is important for all of the assets within our portfolio,” said Lock. As a result, it decided to take Alberta Envirofuels facility offline in October for approximately six weeks to address performance issues and complete some additional preventative maintenance. Keyera expects to have it back in operation later this month. The maintenance activities are intended to facilitate AEF’s continued reliable operation at full capacity until its next scheduled turnaround in the fall of 2022.
To increase the competitiveness and profitability of the segment, Keyera continues to advance its optimization plan in the south region, he said. In September, it suspended operations at its West Pembina and Bigoray gas plants, successfully diverting volumes to nearby Keyera facilities. In 2021, Keyera plans to suspend operations at its Ricinus and Brazeau North gas plants, followed by the Nordegg gas plant in 2022.
The plant closures are expected to increase utilization in the south region to approximately 70 per cent, lower per unit operating costs and reduce Keyera's environmental footprint by eliminating carbon dioxide emissions that accounted for approximately 12 per cent of its 2019 total emissions.
Keyera is currently commissioning Phase 2 of the Wapiti gas plant and finishing the Wildhorse crude oil storage and blending terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. It expects to have the terminal mechanically complete by year-end, and operating in the first half of 2021.
While the second phase won’t be needed immediately, it will allow Keyera to attract aggressively compete for incremental volumes looking for capacity as well as providing a degree of redundancy, Lock said in response to a question. At Wapiti, in particular, Keyera has a number of assets including the compressor station, condensate stabilization and water disposal and those are operating at much higher utilization rates, said Setoguchi. “So we are generating, you know, very strong returns for those parts of the of the facility.”
Subsequent to the third quarter, the Pipestone gas plant began operating in October five months ahead of schedule and on budget.
Liquids Infrastructure 
Keyera's Liquids Infrastructure segment generated an operating margin of $100 million in the quarter, in line with the same period last year. Net processing throughput was 72,000 bbls/d (2019-74,000 bbls/d) for the quarter and 73,000 bbls/d (2019- 81,000 bbls/d) for the nine months.
Demand was strong for its fractionation and storage assets which operated near capacity during the quarter, said Eileen Marikar, senior vice-president and chief financial officer. This part of the business has delivered approximately $100 million in operating margin each quarter, she said.
With high take-or-pay contracts, Keyera’s condensate system cash flow stream remained steady even though volumes were lower compared to the prior year period. As crude oil prices have continued to stabilize, oilsands producers are steadily increasing their bitumen production in the fourth quarter and the company is seeing a recovery in condensate volumes on the system.
The Marketing segment delivered realized margin of $64 million in the third quarter, due largely to Keyera’s iso-octane business, along with its effective risk management program, she said.
Liquidity
Keyera said it continues to maintain a strong financial position with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times, access to $1.4 billion on its credit facility, and minimal long-term debt obligations in the next five years.
Outlook
Looking forward to 2021, Keyera recognizes that while there's a near term uncertainty, “we feel like the worst is behind us,” said Setoguchi. “Our near term priorities will focus on improving reliability, achieving a best-in-class cost structure with our optimization program, company wide cost reduction initiatives, and an emphasis on innovation to find further step changes to our business.”

Energy Sector Well-Being Matters To RMs In Alberta: Kenney | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
During his speech to the Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) 2020 Fall Convention on Wednesday, Premier Jason Kenney acknowledged “there has been friction” between the province and RMA with regards to the linear tax assessment model review, but nonetheless this review has been essential for all stakeholders concerned.
“The reason we brought that issue forward is because we’ve seen many of our, in particular, shallow gas producers teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. We did see a number of failures last year, and we did not want to end up ‘killing the goose that has laid the golden egg’ for rural municipality revenues, for jobs, and for the local rural economy.”
According to Kenney, many energy firms are paying more in property taxes than they do for every other expenditure. In some cases, he said, property tax assessments have been worth more than the entire value of some companies’ assets. This is why the province consulted with municipal leaders to find a “balanced approach” that satisfies the need for reliable tax revenue with the need for companies to stay alive, employing Albertans.
Last month, the Alberta government announced its “nuanced and surgical approach” to overhauling municipal taxes on oil and gas wells and associated pipelines, which includes exempting energy companies from property taxes for three years when drilling new wells and building new pipelines, while also eliminating the Well Drilling Equipment Tax provincewide for new drills.
Further, the province is lowering assessments for less productive oil and gas wells while continuing the recently-introduced 35-per-cent assessment reduction on shallow gas wells for three years. Such actions aim to provide certainty to industry, investors, municipalities and other taxpayers now and into the future, and perhaps to entice new drilling.
Municipal Affairs had developed four scenarios for assessing wells and pipelines, presenting these to a working group for feedback. However, any of these scenarios would force tax rates to increase significantly, services to be reduced, or both, Tracy Allard, minister of Municipal Affairs, noted during last month’s announcement.
Oil and gas companies stressed they would not remain viable unless the province addressed their taxation woes, noted Allard. Therefore, in order to best accommodate both sides, the government chose a new scenario. In the coming months, she added, the province will develop a longer-term review plan for the regulated assessment system, including the ongoing issue of unpaid taxes.
“Perhaps not everyone thinks [the solution is perfect],” Kenney told RMA convention delegates. “As you know, these are incredibly complex issues. But we all have to play our parts in ensuring a future for jobs in rural Alberta, and that is our goal with respect to linear taxation, while also ensuring your access to reliable revenue.”
During his speech on Wednesday, Kenney called on rural municipalities to work with the provincial government and keep the tax burden low in Alberta. He added: “We also need to do better on municipal approvals and red tape.”

"Keystone Investment ‘Sends Message,’ Says Kenney: ‘We’ll Take Control of Our Own Economic Destiny' | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Fighting for Alberta’s oil and gas industry is key to the province, including its rural parts, which is why Premier Jason Kenney believes his government made a “critical investment” when putting up a $1.5 billion equity investment earlier this year and a $6 billion loan guarantee in 2021 towards TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL pipeline project.
Kenney said this investment “sends a message” that Alberta will not passively sit by while others landlock the province’s energy resource.
“The message we have sent is: We’ll take control of our own economic destiny. Just as we continue to put maximum pressure on the federal government to build and complete the Trans Mountain pipeline, we were not prepared to put all of our eggs in that one basket. We needed to hedge against that.”
He added that Keystone XL has created thousands of jobs in rural Alberta, as its construction is well underway. Once completed in 2023, the pipeline will deliver at least 830,000 bbls/d of western Canadian crude oil.
Recovery plan
Earlier this year, the Alberta government announced a recovery plan that aims to create tens of thousands of jobs, making for a more productive long-term economy in part due to massive infrastructure projects — totalling $10 billion — that provide jobs building pipelines, natural gas lines, roads, bridges, overpasses, water projects, and more. Many of the projects, Kenney told this week’s convention, benefit RMA-represented communities.
“We’ve chosen 10 strategic projects across Alberta to do just that, and eight of those projects are in rural Alberta. For example, we’re twinning Highway 3 in the Taber area, widening Highway 40 between Grande Cache and Hinton, and we’re investing in the [Northern Lights Gas Co-op Ltd.]. These projects will invest [$500 million] in our small towns and rural areas over the next six years, and drive economic growth in those areas for decades to come.”

Westcoast Silverstar Project Receives Regulatory Approval | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has approved an application from Westcoast Energy Inc. for the $25 million Silverstar project which includes additional metering capability at its existing Sunset Creek compressor station (CS-16), providing an additional outlet for natural gas on the T-North system.
Westcoast is planning to install a series of meter runs that will be capable of measuring natural gas flows of up to about 1.2 bcf/d, along with auxiliary facilities including discharge piping, station isolation and pressure control valves. The meter station is designed to have enough capacity to meet potential future demands while ensuring the facility is used and economically feasible, it said in its application.
The company said that pending regulatory approval it planned to begin construction in the second quarter of 2021 with an in-service target of December 2021.
In a letter decision, the commission determined that based upon the scale of the project and the nature of the surrounding environment, the project has no or negligible potential impacts on the exercise of Indigenous and treaty rights in the project area. It also determined that the project has no or negligible environmental or socio-economic effects.
The commission said it accepts Westcoast’s submissions that the addition of the Silverstar delivery facility would not functionally re-purpose the T-North system as a whole. The regulator said it is satisfied that the T-North System, including the Sunset Creek compressor station and the delivery facilities at Sunset, will remain functionally integrated after the Silverstar facility is placed in service.
The commission earlier refused a request from NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) to hold a hearing on the matter, arguing that the facilities could have significant and long-term impacts on NGTL and its customers as well as its ability to compete with Westcoast for future LNG market demand.
In opposing a hearing, PETRONAS Energy Canada Ltd. said the Silverstar project would represent an important part of the Westcoast T-North gas transmission system, enabling the flow of gas from the T-North system to the Coastal Gas Link (CGL) pipeline and onwards to the LNG Canada project.
The commission also accepted Westcoast’s request that the cost of the Silverstar project be included in the Transmission North (Zone 3) cost of service and tolled on a rolled-in basis.
In the commission’s view, the delivery facilities at Sunset Creek and Silverstar should receive the same tolling treatment because each metering facility is performing a similar function — measuring gas leaving the Westcoast system for markets not served by Westcoast. It said that any theoretical argument for tolling these metering facilities separately from the T-North System is overridden by practical considerations such as the small role the modest capital cost of these metering facilities would have on the T-North toll.

Invest Alberta To Pitch Alberta ESG Performance To Attract Capital Investment | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Alberta’s newly-created Invest Alberta Corporation (IAC) in part will be leading the province’s advocacy efforts to take the message of Alberta’s “world leading” ESG (environment, social and governance) performance to global capital markets, Premier Jason Kenney said Monday.
“We've been facing these European financial institutions who I think based on false and incomplete information and a lot of political pressure have increasingly been undermining the Canadian oilsands,” he said in a virtual speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce members. “Invest Alberta will be leading our efforts to get in front of key decision makers in European and American capital markets on ESG.”
The province also wants to enlist the help of major law and accounting firms that serve Canadian clients and overseas clients in major commercial centres around the world to help it identify potential investment opportunities. “They know who the dealmakers are, they know where the huge pools of capital reside [and] they've got great networks.”
For the past five years, Alberta’s single biggest problem has been the flight of capital. “We need to turn that around and it's not going to happen by itself,” said Kenney. And while government policies are designed to provide an incentive, “we realize that as a province, we're not doing a good enough job in communicating our message to prospective investors across Canada and around the world,” he told the Chamber.
The government is currently staffing up the government’s network of about 15 Alberta overseas trade offices whose primary mandate will shift to inbound investment promotion from their historical role of outbound export promotion. Although the offices will continue to help with exports, the Alberta government believes that the Canadian Trade Commission network that exists at Canadian embassies and consulates around the world can do much of that job, according to Kenney.
The provincial government, though, also is adding more staff specifically to help promote agricultural exports and critical growth markets primarily in Asia, he noted.
In setting up Invest Alberta with David Legg as chief executive officer, a former advisor to Kenney on capital markets and investment, and Scott Hutcheson, a Calgary developer, as board chair, Alberta looked to the successful Investissement Québec and the investment promotion by the state of Texas, said Kenney.
The IAC’s mandate is to attract “high-impact, job-creating investment to Alberta” and promote the province as a preferred investment destination to national and international investors.
Asked about the outcome of today’s presidential election in the United States, Kenney would say only that his government will work to advance its interests with “whatever government Americans elect.” Alberta also hopes to do so in collaboration with the government of Canada, said the premier. He added that last week he spoke at length about that with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
“Regardless of what happens tomorrow in the United States, we have a strategy to engage key decision makers to advance Keystone XL,” said Kenney. Democratic hopeful Joe Biden has indicated that he would cancel the presidential permit issued by President Donald Trump after former President Barack Obama refused to grant it.
That strategy is obviously critically important, because it is “sort of the canary in the coal shaft,” said Kenney. “If we end up with an administration seeking to abrogate a presidential permit on that border crossing, that is a very problematic precedent that could be applied to other Canadian export pipelines that fuel much of the U.S. economy,” he said.
“So this is, as I've said, to the prime minister, this goes to the heart of our single largest export industry, our $100 billion dollars of exports of Canadian crude to the United States every year,” said Kenney. “So whoever wins, our number one goal will be to protect that market access to the United States for energy profits.”

CER Issues Order To Trans Mountain On Fatality | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has issued an inspection officer order to Trans Mountain regarding the use of trench boxes and contractor oversight in relation to an Oct. 27, 2020 worker fatality at a worksite near Edmonton.
The CER’s order stipulates that Trans Mountain “shall ensure that [the] contracting company, SA Energy Group, immediately cease use and operation of trench boxes until it can demonstrate that they can be used, assembled and disassembled safely. Furthermore, Trans Mountain shall undertake a root cause analysis of the fatality and identify and implement corrective and preventive actions.”
The CER also ordered Trans Mountain to confirm that it has a process to train workers in the safe use of trench boxes, along the entire length of the project. The company must also confirm that it has the inspectors and oversight capability to adequately oversee high-risk project activities for the Trans Mountain expansion project, and if there are any identified gaps, it addresses them.
Alberta Occupational Health and Safety is leading the investigation into the fatality given its role in provincial occupational health and safety matters. The CER shares responsibility for overseeing safety measures for the Trans Mountain expansion project and “we continue to engage with provincial authorities.”
The CER continues to keep the Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring Committee of the Trans Mountain expansion and existing pipeline informed.

TC Energy Eying Potential Hydrogen Opportunities | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
While it’s still early days for Canada’s hydrogen economy, TC Energy Corporation “absolutely” sees a long-term opportunity for the deployment of additional capital into its natural gas transportation assets, says the company’s incoming chief executive officer.
“There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done to understand what percentage of hydrogen could be safely blend with methane for our pipelines,” Francois Poirier, the company’s chief operating officer and president of Power and Storage and Mexico, said in a conference call to discuss third quarter 2020 results. “Our foremost concern is for our employees and the communities in which we operate so we are going to be very careful about making that assessment.”
Many existing natural gas turbines can already accommodate a hydrogen blend, although TC Energy is working hard to understand the long-term impact on factors such as performance, maintenance and integrity, he said.
In addition, some of the company’s storage fields would actually be convertible to hydrogen storage and there could be power generation opportunities “as and when hydrogen becomes more cost competitive,” said Poirier, who will replace retiring CEO Russ Girling Jan. 1, 2021.
“In the longer term, the potential for hydrogen to provide long duration storage in the power sector could be a very interesting opportunity for us and is consistent with our theme of investing in affirming resources as we are developing our pump storage and our battery projects,” he said.
However, asked about a timeline for meaningful hydrogen investments, Poirier said it’s “too early to speculate” on individual investment opportunities at this point.
With more than 1,000 megawatts of power demand between the base Keystone system and Keystone XL, there also is substantial scale for TC Energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the use of solar or wind as power sources, he said. “To the extent we were able to enter into some PPAs (power purchase agreements) to consume renewable energy, it would make us one of the top 10 corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the world,” he said.
There is also an opportunity for the company to electrify some of the compression on its natural gas system, which consumes several hundred thousand horsepower of energy, according to Poirier. “And there’ll be an opportunity there. …We expect as the capital stock turns over and turbines reached the end of their useful lives for us to be considering other alternatives.”
TC Energy, he said, is starting to factor carbon emissions into its capital allocation decisions. “In many jurisdictions, the cost of renewable power is very competitive with other sources.”
And while it’s difficult to quantify the impacts of the cost of carbon emissions without clarity in all jurisdictions, Poirier said the company is confident there will be opportunities for it to develop some renewable projects to meet its own load.
TC Energy, though, wants to see signals about legislation and regulation on carbon pricing and how regulators are going to be using carbon pricing in their cost benefit analysis, added Girling.
“There’s so much uncertainty with respect to it, but this is the direction the marketplace is going,” he said. “And as we see capital stock turn over [in] the next 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, there’s going to be tremendous opportunity for a company like ours to continue to participate in that and deploy capital into infrastructure that’s going to reduce emissions over the long term.”
As to other parts of the value chain, Poirier said TC Energy might be interested in looking at and investing in other pump storage opportunities such as those in Alberta and Ontario. “We think it’s a technology that’s proven on a global scale — about 98 per cent of electricity storage comes from pumped hydro,” he said.
Earlier this year, TC Energy closed an equity investment in Turning Point Generation (TPG), a WindRiver subsidiary. Turning Point is the developer and 100 per cent owner of the Canyon Creek project, a planned pumped hydro energy storage facility to be located near Hinton, Alta.
“To the extent there are other opportunities for us around renewables and battery storage, we are developing some projects here in Alberta and we’ll be continuing to look at projects … along the theme of firming resources,” said Poirier. “We believe as the generation mix continues to trend towards renewables, firming resources will be increasingly important to ensure the reliability of the grid.”
TC Energy, he said, also wants to make sure that it has investments as well diversified as possible, in terms of different fuel types and generation.

"More Proactive Approach Positioning Keystone XL To Advance, Says TC Energy | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
TC Energy Corporation, which completed the international border crossing for Keystone XL earlier this year, believes that a new approach it has taken to the project aligns with the future expectations of either a United States Democratic or a Republican administration, analysts heard Thursday.
“We have taken the past year to listen to all the stakeholders and have made great progress in creating a new vision for the project,” Francois Poirier, the company’s chief operating officer and incoming chief executive officer, said in a conference call to discuss third quarter 2020 results.
The company has signed four labour agreements with leading North American trade unions and has established a Green Energy fund for those unions, he said. It also has partnered with five Canadian First Nations as equity partners in the project. “We’ve taken and will continue to take a pretty progressive step in demonstrating how we’ll develop the infrastructure responsibly and sustainably.”
Poirier was responding to a question about how the company would proceed should Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who has vowed to lift Keystone XL’s presidential permit, be elected president in Tuesday’s U.S. election.
“Certainly there are approaches we can take but we’re taking a more proactive approach and positioning the project to continue advancing it,” he said.
TC Energy is working closely with other nations in Canada and the tribal nations in the U.S. to similarly bring them in as partners, said Bevin Wirzba, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines. “We are operating on their traditional territories and we share a set of core values about the environment and sustainable development,” he noted.
The company anticipates finalizing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2020 and once they are in place it will be able to discuss the equity amounts and the structure of the agreements, said Wirzba.
Apart from the equity investments, TC Energy expects to create $500 million of benefits to the Indigenous nations directly through jobs on the Keystone XL project and with Indigenous suppliers, he said.
Asked about the future of Keystone XL in a more carbon constrained world, Russ Girling, outgoing CEO, defended the continued need for the project.
“What we know is that the U.S. Gulf Coast refinery complex is the largest and most sophisticated in the world and every indication that we have today is that even in a two-degree [global warming] policy environment, the world’s still going to need 60 or 70 million bbls/d of oil,” he said.
“The U.S. will still continue to refine oil and the Gulf Coast complex is still very resilient in that scenario. The options for heavy oil, quite frankly, are limited — the Middle East, Venezuela and Canada.”
The Keystone corridor as it exists today is an extremely valuable corridor and that is being borne out as even in an environment where there has been huge demand destruction in the short run as a result of COVID, it still gets utilized at a very, very high rate and “we would expect that to continue,” said Girling.
“As you look at the third largest crude oil reserve in the world being in Canada connected to the world’s largest and most sophisticated refining complex, that seems to be something that has longevity and stability to it,” he said.
From a business standpoint, the biggest issue the industry has today is lack of egress and that’s why TC Energy knows that Keystone XL and the Trans Mountain pipeline are important and it expects that to continue going forward, said Girling.
Historically, TC has looked long and hard at the fundamentals of a project and then it looks at who's willing to support those fundamentals with long-term contracts, he said. “Right now, I would say if we had any more capacity available on base Keystone, we would be able to sell that capacity for 20-year terms to credit-worthy counterparties.”

Opponents Of Dakota Access Pipeline Are Pressuring Biden | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Bloomberg) — Days after taking office, President Donald Trump cleared the way for construction of an oil pipeline in the Midwest that had been the focus of months of opposition by climate activists, celebrities and Native Americans.
Now opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline are pressuring Joe Biden to take the extraordinary step of returning the favour should he win the White House. Analysts said they couldn't recall a president shutting down an operating pipeline before, which is why it’s being viewed as a litmus test of how far he’d go to appease environmentalists who have supported him.
The project’s construction near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation was the scene of months of protests starting in early 2016 with opponents camping out along its proposed route and that arguing it would damage culturally significant Native American sites and pose an environmental hazard where it crosses the Missouri River.
Shutting down a three-year-old pipeline ferrying more than 500,000 bbls/d would be a drastic step. But it has been operating without a permit following a court decision last summer that allowed it to stay open while an environmental review is conducted, something that could render it uniquely vulnerable to the whim of a new administration.
That’s put the $3.8 billion project in the crosshairs of environmentalists who want to restrict the use of fossil fuels. If Biden wins the presidency next week they will view his decision on the pipeline as an early test of his commitment to fighting climate change
Opponents say a Biden administration has several ways to shut down—at least temporarily—the pipeline, which runs underground from North Dakota across four states and 1,172 miles to Illinois, where it then feeds markets across the Midwest and along the Gulf of Mexico. Biden could revoke its authorization to operate while the Army Corps of Engineers completes the court-ordered environmental review. And it’s possible the agency’s environmental review could result in a decision not to grant a new permit—a move that would require the company to reroute a portion of the line around the disputed land.
A spokesman for the Biden campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The battle over the pipeline is emblematic of the broader fight over climate change and the role of fossil fuel infrastructure. Biden, who said earlier this year he would rescind the permit for the $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline across the Canadian border if elected, hasn’t taken a public position on the Dakota Access oil conduit. But his running mate Kamala Harris in May signed onto a court filing arguing the pipeline should be halted.
A spokeswoman for Dakota Access operator Energy Transfer LP declined to comment.
Proponents of Dakota Access have said the Biden administration should let the environmental review play out.
“Shutting down the line would have significant deleterious impacts on the availability of U.S. crude and, ultimately, refined product,” said Craig Stevens, a spokesman for Grow America’s Infrastructure Now, a pro-pipeline coalition. “Even if Mr. Biden is elected, the country will need close to 20 million barrels of crude oil a day—once the economy fully recovers. Where is that going to come from? I can’t imagine Mr. Biden handcuffing himself right out of the gate by taking Bakken production off the table.”
The pipeline has been operating without a permit to cross under the Army Corps of Engineers’s Lake Oahe in North Dakota since July when a U.S. district court ordered it shut down on grounds that a crucial federal permit fell short of environmental requirements. An appeals court later ruled the Trump administration could allow the pipeline to operate while a more robust environmental review is conducted.
Analysts are split on whether a President Biden would block the project. One distinct option is a halt to the pipeline while the environmental review process is underway, consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners said in a note to clients.
 “We think the Biden administration could choose to make this a poster child,” Christi Tezak, ClearView’s managing director, said in an interview. “If there is a bad environmental review then you don't have a permit.”
At the same time, Tezak said, he may be swayed by the economic impact of shutting down the project. A study commissioned by the trade group American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated that shutting down the pipeline could result in the loss of 3,000 jobs due to depressed drilling activity and other industry investments.
The Obama administration denied approval to complete work on the project in its waning days but Trump revived it shortly after taking office.
 “There is growing scientific data as well as belief on the ground that you can’t stop climate change and build new pipelines, those do not go hand in hand,” said Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and founder of the Bold Alliance, one of several groups that has been lobbying the Biden camp to halt the Dakota Access pipeline. “Vice President Biden can become a climate change president and say we are not building out any fossil fuel infrastructure—period.”
Armed with experienced lawyers and record funding, environmental groups are finding success blocking key pipeline permits in court. Now they’re seeking to enlist the help of a potential Biden administration—which has pledged to wean the country off of global warming greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.
 “The administration could at any point withdraw permission for the pipeline to be in operation,” said Dallas Goldtooth, a “keep it in the ground” organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. “The hope is that if Biden gets into office, one of his first executive actions will be to revoke permission for Energy Transfer Partners to operate the pipeline.”

TC Energy Posts Strong Results In Third Quarter Of 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, TC Energy Corporation assets have been largely unaffected with flows and utilization levels across its North American operations generally remaining in line with historical and seasonal norms, the company said today in releasing third quarter 2020 results.
The only exception is the Keystone pipeline system which has experienced a reduction in uncontracted volumes that is expected to continue until market conditions rebalance and normalize, it said.
Net income attributable to common shares of $904 million (96 cents per share) for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2020 was up 22 per cent from $739 million (79 cents per share) for the same period in 2019.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, net income attributable to common shares was $3.33 billion ($3.55 per share), an increase of 16 per cent from net income of $2.87 billion or $3.09 per share for the same period in 2019. Per share results reflect the dilutive impact of common shares issued under the company’s dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan (DRP) in 2019.
Comparable earnings for the third quarter of 2020 were $893 million (95 cents per share) versus $970 million ($1.04 per common share) in 2019 and for the nine months were $2.87 billion ($3.05 per share) compared to $2.88 billion ($3.11 per share) for the same period in 2019.
The company’s board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 81 cents per common share for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2020, equivalent to $3.24 per common share on an annualized basis.
“Results once again highlight the resiliency of our assets despite significant volatility in global energy markets,” Russ Girling, TC Energy’s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “During the first nine months of 2020, our diversified portfolio of essential energy infrastructure continued to perform very well.” 
TC Energy also continues to advance its $37 billion secured capital program and placed more than $3 billion of assets into service during the first nine months of 2020. Importantly, all of its capital projects are underpinned by long-term contracts, it noted.
Capital spending in the third quarter and nine months was $2.55 billion and $6.67 billion respectively.
TC Energy approved the US$200 million Wisconsin access project to replace, upgrade and modernize certain ANR facilities while reducing emissions on a highly utilized segment of the ANR pipeline system. The enhanced facilities will improve reliability of the system and also allow for additional contracted transportation services of approximately 72 mmcf/d to be provided to utilities serving the Midwestern United States under long-term contracts.
Total capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be approximately $10 billion on growth projects, maintenance capital expenditures and contributions to equity investments.
While it is too early to determine any long-term impact that COVID-19 may have on its capital program, TC Energy said it has observed some slowdown of construction activities and capital expenditures in 2020, largely due to permitting delays as regulators have been unable to process permits and conduct consultations in time frames that were originally anticipated.
While Coastal GasLink continues its review of an updated baseline of cost and schedule, TC Energy said it expects that project costs will rise compared to the previously disclosed estimate due to scope increases, permit delays and COVID-19 impacts. However, it does not expect its future equity contributions to increase significantly following the conclusion of the process.
Field activity on the Coastal GasLink project continues along the pipeline route with crews continuing to incorporate COVID-19 guidelines for construction safety. Ongoing work activity includes construction of roads, bridges, worker accommodations, right-of-way grading and mainline mechanical construction with a majority of the required pipe supply already delivered to site.
In Mexico, the Villa de Reyes project construction is ongoing. The project has been delayed due to COVID-19 contingency measures which impeded the company’s ability to obtain work authorizations as a result of government administrative closures. It expects to complete construction in the first half of 2021.
In March 2020, as a result of COVID-19 impacts, Bruce Power declared force majeure with respect to its Unit 6 MCR and certain asset management work. As the MCR and asset management activities continue to progress, the ultimate impact of the Unit 6 force majeure will depend on the extent and duration of the pandemic and its ability to implement mitigation measures, said TC Energy.
On Oct. 1, 2020, the Unit 6 MCR project achieved a major milestone with the completion of the preparation phase and the commencement of the Fuel Channel and Feeder Replacement Program. Operations on the remaining units continues as normal with scheduled outages on Units 3, 4 and 5 successfully completed in second quarter 2020 and the Unit 8 outage, currently underway, is progressing as expected.
Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings increased to $334 million (2019-$283 million) and $1.31 billion (2019-$794 million) in the three and nine months respectively. Third quarter 2020 results included a $6 million reduction to the pre-tax gain related to the May 22, 2020 sale of a 65 per cent equity interest in Coastal GasLink, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $364 million for the nine months. 
Net income on the NGTL System was $145 million in the quarter, up from $124 million in 2019, and $419 million for the nine months compared to $355 million in the 2019 period.
Segmented earnings for U.S. natural gas pipelines were $644 million (2019-$626 million) and $2.11 billion ($2.08 billion) for the third quarter of 2020 and nine months respectively.
Liquids Pipelines segmented earnings decreased to $342 million in the quarter from $491 million the previous year and to $1.06 billion for the nine months from $1.49 billion in 2019.

Husky Energy Responding To Produced Water Spill Near Rainbow Lake Operations | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Husky Energy Inc. reported a produced water release from a pipeline in northwestern Alberta.
On Oct. 26, an operator conducting a daily inspection discovered a produced water release from a pipeline in the Rainbow Lake area in northwestern Alberta, reported the company.
The six-inch pipeline, which runs from Husky’s Rainbow facility to an injection well, was immediately shut in and government regulators were notified. The water is contained in the pipeline right-of-way and adjacent area of approximately 100 metres by 100 metres in muskeg, which is a mixture of water, peat moss and grass.
The preliminary estimate of 500 cubic metres has been revised to 900 cubic metres.
“Clean-up began promptly using vacuum trucks to remove the produced water, which is recycled water to improve oil recovery. Preliminary testing and sampling determined an elevated saline content in the produced water, and no residual hydrogen sulphide has been detected by personal monitors on-site,” said the company.
There have been no observed injury or impacts to people or wildlife, and fencing has been erected to keep wildlife from the area while cleanup is underway.
Rainbow Lake is approximately 140 kilometres west of High Level.

Secure Energy Bid For Access To Westspur Pipeline Subject Of CER Hearing | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is holding a public hearing into an application from Secure Energy Services Inc. for orders to allow it to receive crude oil from, and deliver crude oil to, the Westspur pipeline owned by Kingston Midstream Westspur Limited.
In a letter to participants, the commission said that in its view, a tailored proceeding to fully consider the relief requested is appropriate, given Secure’s initial application. The commission has proceeded, and will continue to proceed, in a manner commensurate with the particular requirements of this application and attendant procedural fairness considerations.
Initially, shippers had an opportunity to file comments, and now they also have an opportunity to prepare and file evidence, said the commission. There is an opportunity to challenge other parties’ evidence, as well as an opportunity to make final argument, it said.
In comments to the CER, Crescent Point Energy Corp. and Canadian Natural Resources Limited both stated that they were in support of Kingston’s position that the commission should establish a full and robust process that allows parties to the Producers’ Settlement Agreement and shippers on the Westspur pipeline to fully participate. Both Crescent Point and CNRL requested that the process include, at a minimum, a list of participants, a list of issues developed with input from the participants, an information request process, and evidence filing for all parties, and sufficient time for parties to prepare.
For its part, Vermilion Energy Inc. expressed its concern that a ruling by the CER affecting blending services on the Westspur Pipeline System may materially alter the terms of the Producers’ Settlement Agreement to the company’s detriment and as such, it requested that the CER consider dealing with the application on a preliminary basis.
The commission said it denied Kingston’s request that it dismiss the Secure application as it appears to raise material issues within the CER’s jurisdiction. “The information and evidence filed to date suggest that the current Kingston tariffs do not expressly prohibit the operations that could be enabled by the relief sought in the application,” said the commission.
The regulator said it will consider in further detail the claim that facilities requested by Secure would result in an undue burden. However, it noted that Secure stated that it is prepared to pay for any new facilities that may be required.
The commission also will explore the “potentially valid concern” raised by Secure regarding common carrier provisions found in the Canada Energy Regulator Act. “The assertion raised that there would be harm caused to producers will be considered further in the process the commission has set out,” said the CER.

McConaghy: A Probable Biden Presidency – Truth and Consequences | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Many Canadians, including some leading key Canadian economic sectors, may view the advent of a Biden presidency, coupled with Democratic control of the U.S. Congress, as a welcome return to “normalcy.”
What constitutes “normalcy” is debatable, but many hope it would include a restoration to certain trading norms — for example, no longer invoking tariffs on spurious security rationalizations, and restored commitment to existing international security, health and environment organizations and processes. Many hope it also includes less “chaos,” meaning greater predictability in policy direction — almost regardless of the merits of that policy — and, ideally, more alignment with the centre-left policy direction of Canada’s governing Liberals. Presently, this is doubtless the majority view within Canada.
However, for Alberta and its hydrocarbon production sector, a Biden presidency will be extremely problematic, if not utterly disastrous.
Biden will disable the completion of KXL. It is implausible not to think otherwise.
KXL remains the most strategically important hydrocarbon infrastructure project for Alberta, providing the most economic access to its premium long-term market — the U.S. Gulf Coast refining complex, which is optimized to run heavy oil — for its oilsands production.
Despite having in hand a Presidential Permit to cross the Canada/U.S. border as well as completing the KXL international border crossing in Saskatchewan and Montana this past May, a Biden administration will resort to revisiting existing environmental approvals, stretching out the issuance of required normal course federal permits principally for remaining water crossings, and imposing new regulatory requirements to frustrate completion of the project. And who can logically expect much, if any, intervention from the Trudeau government to resist such an assault on Canadian interests?
Disabling KXL is too convenient a gesture to prove Biden’s climate bona fides to much of his leftist base, just as it was for the Obama administration. Imposing costs on Canada is comparatively easy to rationalize, especially if the Trudeau government is indifferent and complicit.
But more broadly and importantly, Biden’s $2-trillion climate plan will only embolden and validate the Trudeau government’s intentions to transform Canadian energy systems and constrain the potential of Canadian hydrocarbon exports, regardless of the net cost to Canada.
Biden’s climate plan is premised on decarbonizing the U.S. electric generation sector by 2035 and ultimately to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. It’s highly doubtful these policy objectives will be met in any material way by reliance on carbon pricing, and more likely will be tackled by massive regulatory and fiscal intervention into U.S. energy markets.
As an example, think of existing extreme climate initiatives in place in California becoming federalized.
Little, if any, tolerance exists for growth in the U.S. hydrocarbon sector from the Democratic base and its Congressional representatives. Biden’s most recent debate performance confirms that he shares that basic attitude. All energy related decisions from his administration will be tested in that context, and apparently with little regard for the costs to be imposed on Americans over the short and medium term.
The current Trudeau government is committed to follow the same fundamental objective. Trudeau has not, as yet, been as candid as Biden has been that the end of hydrocarbon production and consumption is the inescapable consequence of their climate aspirations, regardless of any considerations of net benefit to Canada.
Canada cannot afford to lose the economic contribution of its hydrocarbon production sector. It represents five-10 per cent of Canadian GDP, with no credible alternative available to replace this contribution, notwithstanding the glib invocations of a coming viable “green” economy. This is even more obvious given the massive challenge Canada faces in recovering from the unprecedented levels of debt incurred to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Losing that contribution, and especially growth in that contribution, over the remainder of the decade is enormously problematic.
Climate change is a risk to be dealt with. That has to be confronted by all developed nations, and Canada cannot avoid that reality.
The Trump presidency has been very deficient on advancing any credible climate policy — essentially adopting climate denialism. That has to be acknowledged. A re-invention of the current UN process is required. It’s doubtful that will be pursued by any Trump second term. But that does not stop Canada from being an advocate for such re-invention, one that is based on uniform carbon pricing across developed economies, and balancing better the actual climate risk to be mitigated with the cost of the policy instruments themselves. It could also include gradual rising carbon pricing coupled with adaptation versus massive costs to mitigate — a policy that could see Canada prosper without disproportionate and unjustified sacrifice.
Imperfect choices exist for the U.S. president. But a Biden presidency will be manifestly worse, certainly for Alberta and its hydrocarbon production sector, “normalcy” notwithstanding. Canada needs to advocate for a more credible and proportionate continental climate and energy policy. But first, it has to get to a federal government that actually knows what constitutes “credible and proportionate.” A Canadian federal election, sooner than later, is a pre-condition for that to occur.

Avatar Team Tackles Pipeline Construction Techniques And Trenchless Crossings | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Editor's Note: This article is one in a series that will showcase final presentations from this year’s Avatar Program — an industry-wide leadership, training and collaboration forum held virtually this summer. A partnership between Beaver Drilling Ltd., the Young Pipeliners Association of Canada (YPAC) and the University of Calgary, the program was designed to advance innovative solutions to the oil and gas industry and create new business lines, and engage young professionals. These articles will run each Wednesday.
There were nine teams in total and today we feature the presentation of our eighth team. Read all the articles in this special editorial series here.

One of the main horizontal directional drilling (HDD) challenges is underground uncertainty; a common solution is to drill technical boreholes to get a better understanding of the soil. However, according to one Avatar Program team’s presentation, such a method inevitably requires some assumptions and misses the “full picture” in the earth.
“To solve this problem, what we’re prepared to do is develop an advanced artificial intelligence model to predict the soil along the HDD path,” said Kshama Roy, lead for special projects and pipeline integrity at Northern Crescent Inc. “[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada] has an extensive soil database, mainly for the top one metre of soil, which we use as the base model for our AI algorithm.
“As we go beyond 10 to 30 metres deep, we pilot HDD with geotechnical boreholes at every 100 metres to train the model. Following these two steps, our trained AI model will be able to tell the driller what to expect while drilling by providing a 3D realization of the soil along the HDD path.”
In terms of an environmental solution, Roy’s team proposes using a carbon calculator to determine the emission amount for each HDD path, and then combine it with the AI predictive soil model to find an optimal solution. This carbon calculator is a proven technology and is currently being used in a pilot project in New Westminster, B.C.
“What we’re predicting is that before the pilot project, we actually have an understanding of what the soil is and what they’re going to drill. And so, it makes life very easy and also very cost effective.”
Using AI and machine learning, companies can reduce geotechnical testing cost by half and reduce mechanical design and utility cost by one-third, noted Aadrish Baloch, a project engineer at Wood plc. All of this represents a savings of around 35 to 40 per cent.
“Services like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services have already partnered with BP, Shell and Exxon to transform their exploration drilling and shape the future. The model of the future will be one where AI leverages the power of a high-skilled workforce to control production of smarter machines, increasing returns on investment.”
He added: “We are looking at it from a perspective that geotechnical testing is building artificial intelligence and machine learning models. We won’t necessarily need three holes. If we have a better subsurface visualization, then we can only go with one hole. That reduces our geotechnical testing costs, because it helps us to know what we are drilling through and where to drill reduces our mechanical design and drilling costs.”
Reusing food waste as additives in drilling mud
When it comes to overall HDD costs, disposable drilling waste can get expensive, according to Derek McLean, environmental lead at Surerus Murphy Joint Venture. For this, his team has two solutions, including using variable speed centrifuges and polymers to reduce waste, reuse water and recycle mud. The second solution: Using food waste as additives in the drilling mud.
“Surprisingly, food loss and waste have an 8.2-per-cent share of overall global greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that we can help solve our disposal cost problem, as well as reduce this 8.2 per cent, by incorporating food waste as additives in drilling mud.”
He added: “Food waste products such as mandarin peels, banana peels and potato peels are effective in altering the pH, as well as modifying the rheology of drilling fluids, while others such as date trees are an effective treatment used to stop lost circulation. There are numerous benefits to pursuing this, such as turning unwanted food waste into valuable commercial products, cost savings in disposal, and reduction of overall greenhouse gases.”
Ross Auser, founder of RADesign Inc., told the panel of industry experts that Canada is and will continue to be the best globally at building pipelines, due to a track record of safety and ESG factors, innovation and collaboration.
“We have so many world-class workers, companies and associations that get concentrated in a small area, and they all want to get to work. From an industry perspective, we have an industry with a great generational foundation and a world-leading track record. Investment seems like a safe bet here in Alberta’s oil and gas sector.”
Sparrow to the rescue
With the increasing pressure of higher costs and expectations, both economically and socially, the Avatar team believes that it is critical for Canada’s energy sector to leverage its world-class people and technologies to provide solutions that are both transformative and broadly applicable.
Sparrow Downhole Tools Ltd. is one example of a Calgary-based firm that implements innovative technology to reduce operational costs for its clients, said JT Fetting, the rotary steering tool designer and manufacturer’s director of corporate development. He added that rotary steerable systems are essentially “smart” drilling heads that allow for drilling longer-reach wells while also decreasing the drill time and increasing precision of the well location.
“Our access tools are an instrumental part of the push towards fully-automated drilling. Due to the complexity of the electronics, the functionality of the tool and the operating conditions, the tools are very expensive. This is what separates Sparrow Downhole from the pack. We have developed a simplified design with a smaller number of parts, without having to sacrifice performance.”
Highlights of the design and technology his company brings to the HDD market include an ability to integrate gyro and ranging technology closer to the drill bit. Whereas traditional assemblies locate sensors about 16 to 18 metres back in the bottom-hole assembly, Sparrow Downhole places its sensors significantly closer at four metres back from the bit, dramatically reducing guesswork from onsite steering personnel.
“Our push-to-bit system delivers consistent, predictable build rates to draw a high-quality wellbore, enabling pinpoint accuracy. Continuously recording wellbore position is used to maintain control on target.”

Keystone Faces Biden Risk; TC Energy Touts Union Jobs | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Barack Obama tried to stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Donald Trump tried to revive it. If Joe Biden is elected, he says he’ll block it again — and the pandemic may help him kill the project for good.
Biden has pledged to rescind a key permit granted by Trump for the pipeline, a 1,210-mile (1,950-kilometre) project designed to take 830,000 bbls of crude a day from Alberta to Nebraska. Keystone XL has been on its death bed before, only to come back. But this time the politics are shifting at a moment when demand for oil is weak and other pipelines are moving toward completion more quickly.
“The question should be, is Keystone XL necessary?” said Eric Nuttall, partner and senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners LP in Toronto. “The answer to that is quite clearly no.”
The end of Keystone XL would bring down the curtain on a 12-year drama that has come to symbolize the clash between environmentalists and the oil industry.
A protracted battle over pipelines in Canada has led to some strategy shifts in the oil sector. Calgary-based Cenovus Energy Inc. said Sunday it will buy Husky Energy Inc. for C$3.8 billion ($2.9 billion) in stock. Cenovus executives said the acquisition will boost the company’s refining business, making it less exposed to pipeline problems that have depressed prices for Canadian heavy crude.
Rival projects
The Keystone project has been fought over ever since it was first proposed in 2008 by Calgary-based TC Energy Corporation. Canadian oil producers argue it will give U.S. Gulf Coast refineries access to much needed heavy crude to replace lost production from Venezuela and other Latin American countries. Opponents say the pipeline will allow the higher-carbon oilsands to grow, accelerating climate change.
After years of delays in making a decision, Obama rejected the project in 2015. Just over a year later, newly-elected President Trump granted TC Energy a permit to build, though court challenges have hindered construction.
The Canadian pipeline operator has focused its case on the economic impacts. More than 2,500 people are already working on the right-of-way for the pipeline, spokesperson Terry Cunha said in an emailed statement. “Keystone XL will generate substantial economic benefits to more stakeholders and strengthen North American energy security,” Cunha said.
The company said it has awarded more than US$1.6 billion worth of contracts to six major American union contractors to execute pipeline construction across 800 miles in three states in the U.S. on the Keystone XL pipeline in 2021.
The six contractors will be directly responsible for hiring more than 7,000 union workers in 2021, with special emphasis placed on hiring locally first and giving priority to qualified local and Indigenous-owned businesses. When combined with additional 2021 contracts to be announced later, the total number of American union workers constructing Keystone XL in 2021 will exceed 8,000 and $900 million in gross wages. In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021, creating more than $1.6 billion in gross wages.
“The awarding of 2021 U.S. construction contracts shows the continued momentum behind Keystone XL. The dedicated members of the operating engineers are eager and ready to build this critical piece of modern North American energy infrastructure to the highest quality standards,” said James T. Callahan, general president of the International Union of Operating Engineers. “The 8,000 American union jobs that come with 2021 construction is welcome news and irreplaceable as the U.S. continues our economic recovery.”
The companies awarded contracts include:

Barnard Pipeline (Bozeman, MT);
Associated Pipeline (Houston, TX);
Michels (Brownsville, WI);
Precision Pipeline (Eau Claire, WI);
Price Gregory International (Katy, TX);
U.S. Pipeline (Houston, TX).

But two other Canadian oil export pipelines, the Trans Mountain expansion to Burnaby and Enbridge Inc.’s new Line 3 to the U.S. Midwest, are under construction with fewer regulatory or legal hurdles ahead of them. They are being built as Alberta oilsands producers, reeling from the pandemic, have been cutting capital budgets and focusing on cash flow over growth. For now, they may be more than enough to alleviate pipeline shortages that existed before the pandemic.
Slowing outlook
Canada’s future production growth is a question mark. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that world oil demand won’t return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 and will stop growing by 2030. With Canadian oil prices trading around $30, oilsands companies aren’t focused on expanding production anytime soon.
The “new ethos of no growth” in the industry and a focus on returns for investors and cash flow “really moderates the go-forward production outlook,” Nuttall said.
Government aid
For Alberta, the cancellation of Keystone XL would be a symbolic and financial blow. To jump-start work on the Canadian side, the province agreed earlier this year to fund the first year of construction with a $1.1 billion investment and to guarantee $4.2 billion of loans.
The investment was made knowing the political risks but work will create “facts on the ground,” making it harder for Biden to cancel the project, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income Conference on Oct. 13. The project has the support of Democrat-friendlily unions and Alberta is prepared to defend the project should Biden be elected, he said.
Keystone XL may survive a Biden administration, Dan Tsubouchi, chief market strategist at SAF Group in Calgary, said. While a focus on climate change is part of Biden’s agenda, so are health and the economy. The pandemic may give him room to keep the project going for the sake of jobs, he said.
“I don’t think he pulls it day one,” he said. “He’s ultimately ‘Practical Joe Biden.’”

CER Overseeing Investigation Of Fatality At Trans Mountain Construction Site | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) says it is overseeing an investigation into a fatality on a Trans Mountain worksite in Edmonton.
The contract worker was fatally injured on Oct. 27 at a construction site that is part of the Trans Mountain expansion project.
“We extend our deepest sympathy to the family, fellow workers and all those affected by this tragedy,” the regulator stated. “Our commitment to keeping people safe is at the core of who we are and the work we do. This event is a tragic reminder of why safety is our priority.”
Two CER safety specialists are on-site to oversee Trans Mountain’s investigation of the incident, and work at that site has been halted.
“Our role is to provide oversight of the company and contractor’s respective investigations, and to conduct our own assessment of risk and non-compliances. CER regulations hold companies responsible for the overall health and safety of the company’s contracted workforce,” the regulator stated.
The CER also shares responsibility for overseeing occupational health and safety measures for the Trans Mountain expansion project with provincial authorities. Alberta Occupational Health and Safety is leading the investigation of this incident.
The Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring Committee of the Trans Mountain expansion and existing pipeline has been notified.

CNRL Loses Bid For Dismissal Of Enbridge Mainline Tariff Application | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has denied a notice of motion from Canadian Natural Resources Limited seeking summary dismissal of Enbridge Inc.’s application seeking approval to convert its Mainline service to contract service from common carriage.
In a recent ruling, the commission rejected CNRL’s argument that the application violates the regulator’s filing manual, noting that it earlier had stated that the manual does not require cost of service information in these specific circumstances. The CER “does not have a sufficiently complete record to make findings of fact regarding the appropriate tolling methodology, nor to apply the relevant law to the facts,” it says in a letter to the company.
The commission also found it does not have a sufficiently complete record to make findings of CNRL’s second ground for summary dismissal, that the application which seeks to convert up to 90 per cent of Mainline capacity to contract service is contrary to sections of the CER Act.
It noted that its predecessor, the National Energy Board (NEB) has previously found that, in the appropriate circumstances, an oil pipeline could commit a large portion of its capacity to firm service without being in violation of the legislation. “The NEB has held that it had wide discretion to determine compliance with the common carrier requirements and that a test of reasonableness applied, so that it can tailor the statutory obligations to fit any unique circumstances which may exist,” said the commission.
The CER also found that it would not be fair and just to all parties to decide the application on a summary basis. The Enbridge application raises varied and complex issues and there are multiple parties with diverse views and, at this stage in the proceedings, it has only heard from Enbridge, said the commission. Other parties must have the opportunity to file evidence and argument in support of their views, it said.
“Accordingly, summary dismissal is not proportionate to the nature of the dispute and the interests involved; nor would it achieve a just and fair result for all parties,” said the commission.

Application Filed For $355.5 Million NGTL West Path Delivery Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) has filed an application with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) for approval to build and operate the proposed NGTL West Path Delivery 2023 project.
The $355.5 project is a proposed expansion of the NGTL System to meet incremental delivery requirements at the Alberta/British Columbia border export point and will satisfy the market demand to connect the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) supply with attractive long-term markets, said the company.  
NGTL has asked that the CER issue a report recommending approval of the application in a timely manner that would allow for the federal cabinet to issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) no later than Nov. 1, 2022. The company says this would enable it to fulfill any pre-construction conditions required under the CPCN and begin project construction in time to meet the commercially required in-service date of November 2023.
The project consists of an expected 40.1 kilometres of 48-inch pipeline loop in three sections. The length may increase or decrease (on the order of metres to a few kilometres) within the assessed area as design progresses, says the company in its application. Also, part of the project are mainline valve (MLV) sites and associated piping, associated compressor station tie-in valves and pipe assemblies and launcher and receiver facilities to accommodate pipeline cleaning and in-line inspection (ILI).
The NGTL West Path Delivery 2023 project is underpinned by approximately 175 terajoules/d of incremental Firm Transportation – Delivery (FT-D) service on the NGTL System.
The project does not require an environmental assessment under the federal Impact Assessment Act (IAA) as the length of “new right-of-way” is less than 75 kilometres. However, an assessment is required under Section 82 of the act for the portion of the Longview section of the pipe that crosses Bar U Ranch national historic site, which is on federal land managed by Parks Canada.
Construction is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2023 with clearing/temporary infrastructure work scheduled to begin in the first quarter of that year. All construction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfillment of condition compliance.
To achieve the proposed construction schedule, NGTL is seeking exemptions to the detailed route process for temporary infrastructure required for construction of the pipeline.

CER Defers Decision Into Temporary Service Protocol Extension | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator will hold a further process to assess an application from the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) to extend the Temporary Service Protocol (TSP) on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) System tariff that gives shippers easier access to storage during periods of pipeline maintenance.
NGTL and some shippers have opposed the proposed extension by one year to Oct. 31, 2021 or until the NGTL 2021 System expansion receives leave to open, whichever occurs first.
The federal cabinet recently approved the NGTL 2021 expansion with a capacity of 1.45 bcf/d but the company has indicated it will not be in full operation until March or April of 2022.
Although EPAC had sought a decision on the TSP by Oct. 31, 2020, the commission said it would not issue a final decision by then, as it needs additional information.  However, the CER, which will issue further details about the process, said it believes the application should proceed expeditiously and has required other potential intervenors to apply by noon Oct. 29, 2020.
The commission will consider issues such as changed circumstances since the approval of the NGTL 2021 expansion, supply and markets (price volatility and access to storage), the feasibility of alternatives and toll principles (discrimination, economic efficiency and priority of service).

U.S. Offshore Energy Producers Brace For Hurricane Zeta Impact | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Energy firms and ports along the U.S. Gulf Coast were bracing on Tuesday for another test as Hurricane Zeta, the 11th hurricane of the season, entered the Gulf of Mexico.
BP plc, Chevron Corporation and Equinor evacuated oil workers and Royal Dutch Shell plc paused drilling as winds intensified to 136 kilometres per hour. Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. evacuated an offshore platform and on Tuesday plans to remove workers from a Louisiana natural gas processing plant.
Some oil producers were pulling workers for at least the sixth time since June, a process made more difficult by the novel coronavirus pandemic with workers required to be tested for the virus before returning to work.
Zeta was the third named storm this month to hit Mexico's Quintana Roo state, forecasters said, setting a new record for the month. On Monday, it became the 11th hurricane of the Atlantic season, which on average has six.
A hurricane watch was issued for parts of Louisiana to the Mississippi-Alabama border by the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). Zeta could hit the U.S. coast on Wednesday at or near hurricane strength, the NHC said.
Energy ports from Baton Rouge to Pascagoula were operating under advisories warning of the potential for gale force winds. A Louisiana deep water oil export port said it was implementing its inclement weather plan.
Energy producers shut 16 per cent, or 293,656 bbls/d of oil and six per cent of natural gas output, or 162.57 mmcf/d, according to data from the U.S. offshore energy regulator.
U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore oil production accounts for about 17 per cent of total U.S. crude oil output and five per cent of total U.S. dry natural gas production.
In early Asia trading, U.S. and Brent crude futures both gained a fraction after falling more than three per cent on Monday over fears of rising COVID-19 cases and increased crude supplies.

Russia's Tainted Oil Dispute Drags On As Buyers Fight For Payouts | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Four major buyers of Russian oil are contesting the amount of compensation pipeline monopoly Transneft has offered over the supply of tainted bbls more than a year ago, three sources told Reuters, raising the prospect of legal action.
Up to five million tonnes of Russian oil were contaminated with organic chlorides on their way to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline and a Baltic port in April 2019, forcing Moscow to suspend exports to countries as far away as Germany.
Oil companies and traders from countries including France, Hungary and Kazakhstan, have held talks with Transneft over compensation for the oil, which had to be stored in special facilities, burned or heavily diluted.
Several have agreed to Transneft's payout of up to $15/bbl, but Russia's Rosneft, via its unit Rosneft Deutschland, Italy's Eni and traders Trafigura and Glencore want more, three trade sources said on condition of anonymity.
""They want two-to-three times more than Transneft is offering. This spat may last for years,"" one said.
In total, Rosneft, Eni, Trafigura and Glencore received a total of around one million tonnes of oil which, if not tainted, would have been worth nearly $500 million based on global prices at the time.
The tainted oil was almost worthless. The companies say their costs far exceeded Transneft's compensation offer as they had to pay for storage in tankers and incurred penalties from shipbrokers and buyers, the sources said
In the absence of a settlement, the companies' only option would be to sue Transneft in the courts, the sources said.
Rosneft declined to comment on “existing contract liabilities between the parties.”
Glencore and Trafigura also declined to comment. Eni and Transneft did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for a comment.
All companies were initially reluctant to accept Transneft’s compensation offer of $15/bbl but Kazakh firms, Hungary’s MOL and France's Total SA have since agreed to it.
Two other industry sources, who asked not to be named, said Royal Dutch Shell plc was also likely to accept $15/bbl, but had yet to sign a final deal.
""It is hard to prove the exact loss,"" one of the sources said. ""So $15 is still better than nothing.""
Shell declined to comment.

Alberta Government To Stop Production Curtailment | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Alberta government will stop setting monthly oil production limits to allow producers to utilize available pipeline capacity, the province announced this morning.
While the government will extend its regulatory authority to curtail oil production through December 2021, it will not set production limits due to 16 per cent of Alberta’s crude oil production remaining offline, down from 22 per cent at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
At this time the Alberta government does not plan to resume production limits.
The curtailment program was first announced in late 2018 by the former NDP government in response to a differential that had widened into the $50s at one point.
“Maintaining the stability and predictability of Alberta’s resource sector is vital for investor confidence as we navigate the economic conditions brought on by the pandemic, the commodity price crisis and the need for pipelines. This purposeful approach serves as an insurance policy, as it will allow Alberta to respond swiftly if there is a risk of storage reaching maximum capacity while enabling industry to produce as the free market intended,” said Energy Minister Sonya Savage.
The government will continue to press for the “timely completion of vital pipeline projects, the only long-term solution for protecting the value of our energy resources.”
Since January 2019, production limits have aligned production with export capacity, protecting the value of the province’s oil by helping prevent Canadian crude from selling at large discounts, the province said. The limits were intended as a short-term measure, but ongoing delays to pipeline projects have led to the monthly production limits continuing through November 2020.
“These delays mean that Alberta’s production capabilities still exceed its takeaway capacity, but – due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn — Alberta oil companies have been producing well below the established production limits for several months,” the province said.
The completion of long-awaited pipelines — including Keystone XL, the Trans Mountain expansion, and Enbridge Inc. Line 3 — “will enhance the province’s permanent ability to balance production and takeaway capacity, helping to ensure Alberta’s resources are exported at full value.”
The government said it will monitor production, inventories, pipeline capacity and rail shipments to ensure that production does not exceed what the province can export. Current forecasts show that inventories are expected to remain low, with sufficient export capacity to allow the system to operate efficiently on its own well into 2021.
Should forecasts show storage inventories approaching maximum capacity, the government could put production limits back in place, giving industry 30 to 60 days of advance notice to enable companies to plan their production, the province said.

CBM To The Rescue: Avatar Team Recommends Data-Driven Asset Maintenance Strategy | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Editor's Note: This article is one in a series that will showcase final presentations from this year’s Avatar Program — an industry-wide leadership, training and collaboration forum held virtually this summer. A partnership between Beaver Drilling Ltd., the Young Pipeliners Association of Canada (YPAC) and the University of Calgary, the program was designed to advance innovative solutions to the oil and gas industry and create new business lines, and engage young professionals. These articles will run each Wednesday.
There were nine teams in total and today we feature the presentation of our seventh team. Read all the articles in this special editorial series here.

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) “sets in motion a shift” in understanding and applying operational data, and it is one Avatar Program team’s core recommendation for energy companies to make decisions on their assets.
“What we propose is to shift our maintenance strategy from a reactive to a proactive approach — to leverage and rely more heavily on data to see immediate efficiencies and effectiveness,” Aaron Cho, transformation professional, told a panel of industry experts. “We should be applying the same principles we’ve already applied to cars and other industries onto our industry. It is only through this mindset that we can remain competitive through our reality.
“The bottom line is that failure on a single piece of critical equipment can be catastrophic and justify the entire cost of implementing CBM.”
As a maintenance strategy that monitors the actual condition of an asset to decide what maintenance must be done, CBM looks for certain indicators that show signs of decreasing performance or upcoming failure. Checking equipment for these indicators is applicable to mission critical and non-mission critical assets. It allows for optimal scheduling of preventive and corrective actions, which reduces total cost of ownership on an asset.
Rebecca Lloyd, senior control centre engineer at Enbridge Inc., said CBM fits naturally at the intersection of asset management and maintenance planning, using data as a resource, starting with asset owners providing input on equipment criticality. Using failure mode and effects analysis and fault tree analysis, technical experts then map out how this equipment can fail.
“With raw or manipulated data, an indicator for each failure mode is developed. We ask ourselves what failures would look like in the data we have, whether it be excess vibration or temperature, thresholds for each indicator are established, and their relative importance is weighted. In this way, we have both individual indicators and a means to aggregate data for visualization and analytics.”
Linking new data insights to the maintenance planning process culminates in automatic work-order generation on equipment condition, she added, which is how companies can use CBM for data-driven maintenance decisions.
“Imagine that this exists for every piece of critical equipment on your system, and any time a work order red lines, work orders are automatically sent to correct certain issues. This is the evidence that maintenance is needed, whether it be more or less often than preventative measures would suggest.”
Potential risk matters
Much of CBM’s value derives from controlling for potential risk, according to Graeme Marshman, chemical engineer at Spartan Control Ltd., but quantifying potential risk is difficult. Reducing asset downtime and increasing uptime, allocating resources through more efficient planning, increasing equipment reliability with lifetime, optimizing data-driven decisions and ESG-related intangibles all comprise improved “business-as-usual operations” through CBM.
“Let’s compare comparable benefits of CBM in the oil and gas industry. [Let’s say] an asset generates $3 million per day, and has a five-per-cent downtime for maintenance. If CBM is able to reduce the downtime by an additional 10 per cent, then that would equate to a potential increase in revenue of $5.5 million annually for that asset alone.”
A good example of where industry applies CBM right now is on integrity digs with respect to midstream firms, he said, with crews relying on data gathered through asset inspections used to model for predictive failures, which is key for scheduling digs.
“It is being used at a small scale, and the option to expand on that further in order to be able to encompass more of the assets that would drive more value. We’ve started with really small projects, and it’s really the full implementation and connecting of those different databases where we can learn more about assets to do better predictive maintenance.”
A competitive advantage
Many industries are increasingly accepting CBM is a competitive advantage, noted Gabrielle Vaillancourt, business analyst at TC Energy Corporation, and finding a way to combine databases is key to implementation.
“In the current economic environment, companies have to remain focused on operations and efficient operating methods if they want to remain competitive,” she told the industry experts. “When it comes to implementing CBM, start small and let the scope grow once you have a [dependable] understanding of your data.”

Tribes Make New Move To Shut Down Dakota Access Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– Native American tribes opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline once again have asked a federal judge to stop the flow of oil while the legal battle over the line's future plays out.
The Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes succeeded on their first attempt, only to have an appeals court overturn U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s shutdown order earlier this year. Now, they're asking the judge to clarify his earlier ruling to satisfy the appellate judges and then to again order the line to cease operations, the Bismarck Tribune reported.
The tribes argue that potential harm to their water supply outweighs any economic impacts of shutting down the line, which has been moving North Dakota oil to Illinois for more than three years.
“The Tribes are irreparably harmed by the ongoing operation of the pipeline, through the exposure to catastrophic risk, through the ongoing trauma of the government's refusal to comply with the law, and through undermining the Tribes' sovereign governmental role to protect their members and respond to potential disasters,'' attorneys Jan Hasselman and Nicole Ducheneaux wrote in a Friday filing.
Tribes fear a spill into the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Reservation would pollute their water supply. Pipeline operator Energy Transfer and the Army Corps of Engineers both maintain the pipeline is safe. Prolonged protests in 2016 and 2017 drew thousands of people to camps near the river crossing and resulted in hundreds of arrests.
U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Danielle Nichols declined to comment Monday on the tribes’ filing. The Corps and Energy Transfer have until Nov. 20 to file a formal response.
Boasberg, who is overseeing the four-year-old lawsuit filed by the tribes, ordered an extensive environmental study last spring because he felt previous, less-extensive environmental analysis by the Corps left lingering questions.
Boasberg in July revoked the easement that allows for the river crossing and ordered the pipeline shut down until its environmental soundness was proven. A federal appeals court allowed oil to keep flowing, however, ruling that Boasberg hadn't justified a shutdown. That same appeals court is now determining whether to uphold his decision regarding the study.
Tribes are asking Boasberg to issue an injunction to shut down the pipeline while the legal fight plays out.

Ovintiv To Start Bi-Directional Flow On Tupper Hythe Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Ovintiv Canada ULC notified the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) of its intent to start the bi-directional flow on the Tupper Hythe pipeline between the existing compressor stations at 15-31- 074-13W6M and a-029-H/93-P-09.
“While this work does not meet the cost threshold (>$1 million) as required by the streamlining order, Ovintiv is nevertheless providing notice of this project,” the company said.
Ovintiv requires bi-directional flow on the existing 23-kilometre NPS 4 Tupper Hythe line for operational and maintenance purposes, in order to provide an alternative source of fuel gas for its Dawson South assets located at and downstream of the a-029-H/93-P09 compressor station
The current sweet fuel gas supply tied into the NPS 4 Tupper Hythe line splits at Ovintiv’s d-064-I/93-P-08 riser site, with volumes flowing northbound to a-029-H and eastbound to 15-31. Bi-directional flow capabilities in the NPS 4 Tupper Hythe line will allow for Hythe Gas Plant (11-18-074-12W6M), located east of 15-31, to be a new source of sweet fuel gas. The fuel gas line from Hythe Plant is connected to the NPS 4 Tupper Hythe line via a four-inch double block and bleed (DB&B) valve at 15-31 that is currently carseal closed.

Federal Government Approves NGTL 2021 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The federal government has approved the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) 2021 System expansion project with 35 conditions.
The government was to have decided on the project by May 2020 but the deadline was extended to no later than Oct. 19 at the request of several Indigenous communities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In making this decision, the federal government has made amendments to the Canada Energy Regulator's (CER) conditions for approval, related to caribou and Indigenous engagement.
“In particular, we strengthened five conditions proposed by the regulator and added one new condition in order to better address impacts to section 35 Indigenous rights and help mitigate the disruption of the project's construction on caribou habitat,” the government said.
As part of these updated conditions, NGTL will now be required to restore 3,840 hectares of caribou habitat (30 times the size of the habitat impacted by the project) and seek to establish an Indigenous Working Group to assist with the planning for restoration and monitoring for the protection of the Little Smoky Caribou range.
“We also approved a new accommodation measure to expand eligibility for the Terrestrial Cumulative Effects Initiative to monitor the cumulative impacts on the environment,” the government said.
In total, the proponent must comply with 35 binding conditions related to safety, environmental and wildlife protection, Indigenous engagement, and protection or Indigenous rights and interest.
Over the past 17 months, Natural Resources Canada undertook extensive Crown consultations as part of fulfilling our duty to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate and mitigate potential impacts on the rights and interests of Indigenous communities. 
“The $2.3-billion project is of significant importance in Alberta and for economies across the country. It will help power the successful restart and recovery of our economy by creating up to 2,920 jobs and contributing about $1.2 billion to Alberta's GDP. NGTL 2021 will give natural gas producers better access to markets for their products. The project will also help facilitate the phase out of coal-fired electricity by 2030,” the government said.
NGTL expects that this approval will allow it to immediately progress construction activities in accordance with regulatory requirements, with compressor station field work expected to begin in December 2020 and pipeline construction activities expected to start in January 2021.
 “We’re pleased to be moving forward with this project,” said Tracy Robinson, executive vice-president, president Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines and president Coastal GasLink. “This capacity is vital to our customers, our industry and to the people who rely on the energy we deliver. We estimate this project will create up to 5,500 well-paying construction jobs for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous workers and will bring a much-needed economic boost to communities across Canada, especially in Alberta.”
Once facilities are placed in service, which will occur through 2021 and into 2022, the 2021 NGTL System expansion project will provide critical incremental capacity to customers.
This project is a critical component of the $9.9 billion NGTL infrastructure program underway, which will add 3.5 bcf/d of incremental delivery capacity between 2020 and 2024.

Minnesota Judge Upholds State Decision On Enbridge Line 3 Pipeline Replacement | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– A Minnesota judge on Friday ruled that the state’s pollution regulator and Enbridge Inc. used proper methods for water crossing for its Line 3 oil pipeline replacement, clearing another hurdle for the project that has faced years of delay.
Judge James LaFave upheld the draft water quality certificate that Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued to Enbridge in February, quashing challenges by activist groups and indigenous bands that had raised concerns regarding Enbridge’s intentions to protect streams and wetlands the pipeline crosses.
Line 3, built in the 1960s, carries less oil than it was designed for because of age and corrosion. Replacing it would allow the company to boost flow from a Canadian oil hub in Edmonton to Midwest refiners.
The report said the petitioners have failed to prove that the agency and Enbridge “undercounted the full acreage of wetlands that will be physically altered by trenching.”
A shortage of pipelines has weakened Canadian oil prices in recent years, but capacity became ample this year after deep oil production cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Enbridge said on Friday it continues to work with permitting agencies for the timely issuance of remaining permits in order for construction to start before year end 2020.

Transforming Waste Into Renewable Natural Gas | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Canada’s largest city is poised to be one of the first cities in North America to harness the green energy potential of its municipal organic waste by turning it into pipeline-ready renewable natural gas.
Last year the City of Toronto installed biogas-upgrading equipment at its Dufferin Organics Waste Management Facility to clean and condition the raw biogas (produced from processing organics) to turn it into renewable natural gas (RNG) through a partnership with Enbridge Gas Inc.
The first molecule of RNG is anticipated to flow through the city’s pipeline distribution system this month.
Carlyle Khan, acting deputy general manager, Solid Waste Management Services for the municipality, said the Dufferin site will produce approximately 3.38 million cubic metres of RNG a year.
A second organics site is currently in the pre-design phase and is expected to be operational by 2022. Planning is also underway for the city’s Green Lane Landfill site, with the Keele Valley Landfill site to follow and most likely to begin work in 2021.
An estimated 65 million cubic metres of RNG per year will be produced once all sites are fully operational.
“Originally, the city was looking at using a portion of the RNG produced to fuel waste collection trucks and potentially selling the rest to generate revenue that could be reinvested into green waste management infrastructure projects,” said Khan. “In 2019, city council declared a climate emergency and adopted a stronger emissions reduction target for Toronto — net zero by 2050 or sooner — accelerating and strengthening the goals outlined in the city’s TransformTO Climate Action Plan.”
To help achieve these targets, Solid Waste Management Services shifted its strategy from potentially selling RNG to third party consumers to an approach that allows the municipality to realize the environmental benefits of the RNG — fuelling the city’s 150 solid waste collection trucks, said Khan.
In July, Toronto City Council adopted Citywide Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategy through Blending Renewable Natural Gas and Natural Gas, a Low-carbon Fuel Option, a report that allows the RNG produced at organics processing facilities to be blended with conventional natural gas used by Toronto’s agencies, boards and corporations to create a low-carbon fuel blend of RNG/natural gas that will allow for increased greenhouse gas emission reductions across the city.
The city and its agencies, boards and corporations purchase a combined 110 million cubic metres of conventional natural gas annually.
Khan said the production of RNG has the environmental benefit of closing the carbon loop by capturing the biogas produced instead of flaring it off into the atmosphere, upgrading the biogas to RNG pipeline quality and using the RNG to displace a non-renewable fossil fuel with a renewable green fuel.
“Harnessing RNG helps support the city’s long-term waste management strategy and moves the city closer to a closed-loop approach where organics collection trucks can ultimately be powered by the waste stream they collect,” she said. “It also supports the goals of TransformTO, the city’s Climate Action strategy.”
Robert Dysiewicz, Enbridge Gas Inc.’s RNG manager, business development for Ontario, said when thinking about renewable natural gas, it is about looking at the entire cycle of how organic waste is treated.
“In most countries [what we did traditionally] is put [organic waste] in our landfills along with all the other garbage.
“Over time it starts to decompose and starts to release a bunch of things, one of which is methane. We realized that if we capture that and put it into an organic digester instead of releasing what we capture, and improve it, it becomes … pipeline ready gas.”
RNG leverages existing infrastructure as opposed to new infrastructure required for renewables such as wind and solar.
“From a utility perspective the more renewable content we can move into our pipelines, the better it is for us as an energy company because we have a role to play in the transition to an increasingly more renewable fuel content,” said Dysiewicz. “Any time we can introduce renewable content into a system that’s an advantage for society ... Any time we take steps towards projects like this — whether it is renewable natural gas or clean hydrogen — all of those concepts carry a benefit for us and society and a country from a competitive standpoint.”
Enbridge Gas is currently working to identify and develop new sources of RNG to add to its pipeline infrastructure. Several municipalities in Ontario have either constructed or are in the process of building digesters to create raw energy from waste.
A greener Canada 
RNG and biogas projects are increasingly being developed and operated across Canada — primarily in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec — in advance of incoming regulations including the Clean Fuel Standard, which sets prescriptive renewable fuel mandates and covers all fossil fuels in Canada, and the desire to reduce emissions.
According to the Canadian Biogas Association there are more than 100 operating biogas projects generating renewable electricity and heat, and close to a dozen RNG facilities across Canada.
Last year the Quebec government mandated a minimum quantity of RNG to be delivered by natural gas distributors at one per cent in 2020, and five per cent in 2025. Then in March 2020, the Quebec government announced $70 million in financial assistance to support renewable natural gas production in the province, of which $45 million will be used to develop eight RNG production projects.
Stéphanie Trudeau, Énergir’s executive vice–president, Québec, said the financial assistance will help accelerate the development of these types of renewable energy projects.
“Renewable natural gas is a clean, local energy that helps combat greenhouse gases and provides economic benefits wherever projects are developed. These projects are perfectly in line with the economic recovery launched by the Government of Québec,” she said.
Vancouver-based G4 Insights Inc. recently completed its field demonstration project that took forestry industry biomass and transformed it into pipeline grade RNG in Edmonton. A large-scale, commercial demonstration of RNG from forest biomass, preferably in Canada, is the next step, said the company.
ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. is also delving into the RNG waters.
The company received $16 million in grant funding for a commercial demonstration project to produce RNG from biogas at an agricultural operation. The RNG will be injected into the Alberta pipeline system where a portion will be used within Alberta’s compressed natural gas fleet vehicles and commercial applications. The company is currently in negotiations with Future Fuel RNG, and is expected to sign an agreement in the coming months.
Already ahead of many companies in Alberta, Lethbridge Biogas announced in July it was allocating $7 million (with Lethbridge County) to expand the company’s existing facility to purify the biogas into pipeline-grade biomethane or RNG, which will be injected into ATCO’s natural gas grid.
Lethbridge Biogas director of operations Stefan Michalski, who also works on the national level as co-chair of the Canadian Biogas Association, said in a release the expansion is another significant milestone in the history of the project. The facility is scheduled to turn on the RNG taps by mid-2021.
“A lot of players in the RNG market were interested to become part of this expansion, as RNG has become a highly sought-after commodity to reduce the carbon footprint in the natural gas supply chain,” he said.
The RNG produced at the facility will also be supplied to FortisBC under a long-term supply agreement by mid-2021. “With this in place, we will be able to expand on future feedstock opportunities and will be a reliable partner for sustainable disposal of organic resources in the community for decades to come,” said Michalski.
British Columbia leading the way in RNG
In March 2017, the B.C. government amended the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Regulation to include a renewable portfolio allowance of up to five per cent RNG on the natural gas system, according to the Canadian Biogas Association. Currently there are five active and two upcoming RNG projects in British Columbia.
FortisBC currently has 20 agreements for projects, of which five are currently operational in the province. The company is investing $4.9 million per year through its Clean Growth Innovation Fund to fund projects with partnerships such as its renewable gas initiatives.
Recently the company announced a project with the Capital Regional District in British Columbia to use the Hartland Landfill to make RNG. As well it has partnered with REN Energy International Corporation on a project that converts wood waste from forestry operations, sawmills and other wood product manufacturers to RNG at a new facility in Fruitvale, B.C.
The facility is expected to be in service in 2021, and when operational it will produce more than one million gigajoules of RNG annually.
Scott Gramm, FortisBC’s manager of RNG, said the company’s goal is to have 15 per cent of its total gas supply coming from renewable sources by 2030 and to have a 30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, which is in line with commitments in the province’s CleanBC promise.
Gramm said the company is very excited about the potential of using wood waste — wood chips, sawdust et cetera — as a feedstock because British Columbia is a forest-rich province. Methane produced from the wood waste will be exactly the same as the methane found in conventional natural gas.
“What’s unique about that is this is the first time anybody has put together [a] process from wood all the way to pipeline quality gas on a commercial scale in Canada,” he said. “No one has done that before. They are currently doing design work so we have an agreement with them for long-term purchase of renewable natural gas and we have British Columbia Utilities approval for that contract. This is a very exciting opportunity because it opens a door to the much bigger opportunity in terms of volume.”
The utility company has been researching RNG for more than 10 years. When it first started, the company introduced a voluntary RNG program for its customers.
Today, the company has suspended new enrollments because the demand is outstripping the supply, said Gramm.
“[RNG] makes use of a safe, reliable energy system that has been in place for a lot of years especially in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta,” he said. “That infrastructure is well-managed, well-maintained and well-established.”
Jas Baweja, FortisBC corporate communications specialist, added the company is working toward a 15 per cent goal by 2030, which means partnering with municipalities and involves gaining access to landfills and waste management facilities.

"Phillips 66 Needs To Offer Evidence To Support Toll Complaint, Says Keystone | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd. has repeated an earlier request to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) that it dismiss without further process a complaint from Phillips 66 Canada Ltd. about a proposed increase in 2020 variable tolls on the Keystone pipeline system in Canada unless it files evidence to support the complaint.
“Phillips Canada filed the complaint and as the applicant to its complaint, it has the onus to support its application,” says Keystone in a letter to the commission. Phillips has provided no evidence to support the suggestion that the proposed toll is not just and reasonable nor has it identified any specific costs reflected in the variable tolls that it believes were not prudently incurred, said Keystone in response to a CER request for comments on the process. 
“The mere fact that forecast costs are increasing does not make the subject toll unjust or unreasonable,” said Keystone. “In fact, over the past 10 years, Keystone’s variable toll has increased and decreased on numerous occasions, without complaint.”
In its complaint, Phillips Canada said TC Canada has not provided sufficient or timely supporting factual or financial information such that shippers may determine whether the costs included in the variable toll and the resulting increases are appropriate, or whether the 2020 variable tolls are just and reasonable. Husky Oil Operations Limited and Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC (CRRM) expressed their support for the application.
Keystone also told the CER that the scope of any process dealing with the complaint should be focused on the issues of whether the determination of the estimated 2020 variable tolls was done in accordance with the approved methodology as agreed to by shippers.
The company noted that in 2007 and 2008, the National Energy Board (NEB) approved the tolls and tariff applied for by Keystone, finding that the committed tolls, both fixed and variable, were just and reasonable given that Keystone’s proposed methodology for establishing committed tolls resulted from negotiations between sophisticated arm’s-length parties and that no party raised objections. Parties agreed to pay the contract tolls as set forth in the contract, including tolls determined with the annual adjustment mechanism, said the company.
The proposed toll is a routine annual filing submitted in accordance with toll design methodology approved in the Keystone decisions, according to Keystone.
“An interim toll is submitted annually in accordance with and subject to the terms set forth in contractual agreements as agreed to by Phillips Canada, Husky and CRRM,” it said. “Phillips Canada is effectively trying to amend the terms of its long-term contract. It is improperly attempting to transform a commercial dispute into a regulatory matter.”
The costs reflected in the variable tolls reflect the prudently incurred costs to operate the Keystone pipeline system during the period — without which transportation service would have been impacted, said Keystone. “Phillips Canada has not identified any specific costs reflected in the variable tolls that it believes were not prudently incurred. Further, the variable toll was calculated in accordance with the approved toll methodology and is subject to a true-up mechanism.”
In a Dec. 27 order, the CER suspended the Keystone application for a proposed 22.5 per cent increase in variable tolls in Canada and made the existing tolls interim effective Jan. 1, 2020.
However, by not allowing the proposed roll to go into effect, shippers are not paying the estimated costs required to operate the pipeline, said the company. “Keystone’s proposed toll is intended to reduce the final true-up and mitigating toll shock. The longer that the current interim toll is in effect, the greater the potential toll shock to shippers when the true-up mechanism is applied due to the under collection relative to the estimate.”
Keystone also took issue with the commission’ s characterization of its proposed toll as an “application.” The NEB, it said, determined that Keystone’s committed and uncommitted tolls are determined with reference to negotiated agreements rather than on a cost of service basis and therefore the company is required to comply with all toll filings pursuant to the NEB Act.
 The proposed toll was not filed for approval but as a tariff in effect with an effective date of Jan. 1, 2020, said Keystone. “Therefore, the only application before the commission is that from Phillips Canada to suspend the proposed toll through the relief requested in its complaint.”

CER Asked To Approve Alternative Route For Trans Mountain Expansion In Coldwater Valley | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC has opted for an alternate route for its expansion project in response to concerns from the Coldwater Indian Band that the approved corridor could present a risk to the reserve’s underground water supply, the main source of its water.
The company is seeking Canada Energy Regulator (CER) approval for the West Alternative Route, a corridor along the west side of the Coldwater Valley to the northwest of the reserve near Merritt, British Columbia to avoid risks to the greatest extent possible to the main supply of water sourced from an aquifer underlying the reserve. The approved Eastern Route corridor is on the east side of the reserve.
In the variance application, Trans Mountain said it has confirmed Coldwater’s support of the application, subject to further engagement with the community. The company said it also has engaged with all other potentially affected Indigenous groups, landowners and other stakeholders regarding the proposed re-route and is not aware of any outstanding concerns. Trans Mountain will continue to engage with these parties throughout the commission’s review process and the life of the project.
Trans Mountain pointed out that work on the expansion project is well underway with the current anticipated in-service date no later than Dec. 31, 2022. In order to meet this timing, construction-related activity on the West Alternative Route, including mobilization, should begin by August 2021, it said.
 The West Alternative Route includes two trenchless crossings of the Coldwater River that require significant lead time and are subject to execution risks, which can prolong execution timelines, said Trans Mountain. In addition, tree clearing can only practicably be achieved outside of the restricted activity period associated with migratory bird nesting  (March 26 through Aug. 17), it said.
Trans Mountain anticipates construction of the expansion project and related activities for the extent of the West Alternative Route are anticipated to take approximately 11 months.  These construction activities must be complete prior to undertaking hydrostatic testing, valve installation and commissioning activities, all of which must be done prior to beginning commencing operations by the end of 2022.
Should the revised route require federal cabinet authorization, Trans Mountain said it believes a CER recommendation on the variance application is required by April 2021 to enable a cabinet decision and, if approved, an order in council issued by July 2021. An amended certificate, orders and ancillary approvals from the commission would be required shortly thereafter to enable construction to begin in August 2021.
Trans Mountain said it believes that the requested 10-month processing time is achievable in the circumstances, “given the extensive regulatory history and precedent on the project, the fact that the variance application reflects an accommodation of Indigenous concerns and the lack of express Indigenous or stakeholder opposition to the West Alternative Route to date.”
The company also expects that the process would require co-ordination of Indigenous consultation efforts with the federal Ministry of Natural Resources and the province of British Columbia.
Trans Mountain said that to support an efficient regulatory process and timely decision, it intends to file and serve its plan, profile and book of reference (PPBoR) for the West Alternative Route by Jan. 31, 2021 and to submit revisions or additions to applicable pre-construction project condition compliance filings by April 30, 2021.

Illinois Approves Expansion Of Dakota Access Oil Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Illinois regulators late on Wednesday approved an expansion of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, the largest pipeline running out of North Dakota’s Bakken shale basin, rejecting a bid by environmental groups to block the project.
The Dakota Access Pipeline can transport about 570,000 bbls/d of crude oil from North Dakota to the Midwest, with connections to the Gulf Coast. It had been a source of controversy prior to its completion in 2017, and there is an ongoing legal challenge over whether the line should remain operational after a federal court earlier this year scrapped a key permit.
The Illinois approval is separate from that case.
In an order on Wednesday, the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) said additional pumping stations and equipment needed for the pipeline's capacity to be nearly doubled to 1.1 million bpd are necessary and would promote the security and convenience of the public.
""We are pleased with the decision by the ICC ... this now allows us to proceed with the optimization of the pipeline and allows our labor union partners to go to work,"" Energy Transfer spokeswoman Lisa Coleman said in an email.
Environmental groups including Save Our Illinois Land and the Sierra Club, which opposed the expansion, had told the ICC that the oil price downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic reduced the need for the expansion.
Sierra Club did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, Energy Transfer told investors it expects to have expanded capacity available on the line by the third quarter of 2021.
In July, the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia determined that the pipeline violated environmental law and vacated its permit to operate on federal land. The company has appealed the district court's decision.

Alliance Receives CER Approval For Revised Tolls | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has approved as filed an application from Alliance Pipeline Ltd. for higher tolls and tariff amendments reflecting the annual update of pipeline abandonment surcharges to be effective Nov. 1, 2020.
In a letter to the commission, the company, the general partner of the Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnership, said it was not aware of any shipper objections to the revised tolls. Alliance initially raised the issue of tariff and Alliance Transportation Access Policy (ATAP) amendments with its shippers through an email to the Canadian Alliance Pipeline Shipper Task Force.
The year-over-year increases in the Pipeline Abandonment Surcharge for the upcoming gas year range  from 22 per cent  to 45 per cent depending on the service type and zone. The resulting surcharge for Zone 1 receipt service, for example, will increase by 22 per cent to 1.4 cents/mcf from 1.2 cents/mcf as of Nov. 1, 2019 while the surcharge for full-path service in Zone 2 will rise by 40 per cent to 3.4 cents/mcf from 2.4 cents/mcf.  
Alliance said the increases on a per unit toll basis are the direct result of an overall decline in system throughput that started in the latter stages of 2019, as evident in the under-collected deferral account balance amounts from the previous year, as well as the usage of a lower throughput forecast that is more in alignment with current levels.
The $12.65 million total Annual Contribution Amount (ACA) includes the prior CER-approved ACA and prior period deferral of underpayments.
The commission approvals included tariff amendments effective Oct. 15, 2020 in which Alliance is proposing to extend eligibility for permanent and temporary relocations to shippers that contract for receipt or full-path seasonal service with a contract term of one month or greater. Under the current tariff, permanent and temporary relocations are limited to firm receipt and full-path shippers with firm transportation service agreements with an initial term of three years or greater.
“This added service flexibility will assist short-term shippers in their management of upstream natural gas supply interconnections and related arrangements,” Alliance said in its application. The current permanent / temporary, within-path / out-of-path priority sequence ranking process will be adopted for seasonal service relocations, but long-term firm service relocation requests will be processed ahead of seasonal service relocations, it said.
Alliance also has approval for changes in capacity allocations for seasonal service open seasons it made in June 2020 to its access policy to provide more flexibility for shippers bidding in open seasons for seasonal service offerings. In accordance with Alliance’s current tariff provisions, capacity is awarded to shippers in an open season for seasonal service based on the bids that result in the highest net present value of demand charge revenues to Alliance.  
However, there may be times when bids for seasonal service vary in contract duration, said the company. Under those circumstances, it may at times be preferable to allocate seasonal service capacity on the basis of highest bid toll, with capacity allocated in descending order of bid toll. For bids at the same toll, priority would be given to bids with an earlier start date, with remaining available capacity allocated on a pro rata basis.

Russian Companies Settle Row With Total Over Dirty Oil Supplies | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and producer Rosneft have reached a settlement with Total over dirty oil supplies to the French company's Leune refinery in Germany, Transneft said on Tuesday.
Up to 5 million tonnes of Russian oil en route to central Europe via the Druzhba pipeline were found to be contaminated last year. Total declared a force majeure in June 2019 on the production of jet fuel at its Leuna refinery in Germany following the supply of contaminated crude from Russia.
Transneft did not disclose how much compensation would be paid to Total SA.
The pipeline operator, headed by Nikolai Tokarev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had said it would pay compensation of no more than $15/bbl.
It had been agreed that buyers such as BP plc, Shell, Total, Eni and PKN Orlen would put forward claims to Russian suppliers, while Transneft agreed to bear the brunt of the contamination-related costs.
Russian exporters, such as Rosneft, would then address buyers' claims to Transneft for compensation.
Transneft has compensated Hungary's MOL and all the Kazakh companies affected by crude oil contamination in its pipelines. Organic chlorides were found in Urals crude export flows in late April last year.

Federal Cabinet Yet To Decide On NGTL 2021 Expansion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. and natural gas producers are still waiting for a federal cabinet decision on the proposed $2.31-billion NGTL 2021 expansion, which is due by Oct. 19, 2020.
The government was to have decided on the project by May 2020 but the deadline was extended to no later than Oct. 19 at the request of several Indigenous communities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ian Cameron, press secretary for federal Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan, said in an email.
“It is a core responsibility of the federal government to help get our natural resources to new markets and create good jobs,” said Cameron. “This is only possible when we meet our constitutional duty to meaningfully consult with potentially impacted Indigenous communities.”
He did not say whether there would be a further extension of the deadline.
The NGTL 2021 expansion project consists of approximately 344 kilometres of natural gas pipeline and associated facilities in the Peace River project area that would be constructed in segments from Grande Prairie to a point north of Calgary.
The 1.45-bcf/d pipeline is designed to transport natural gas from the western side of the system to the growing demand on the east side. If approved, it would “loop” the existing NGTL System with the new pipeline connecting to existing NGTL segments or running adjacent to existing lines.
The expansion had a commercially required in-service date of April 30, 2021, but NGTL has revised the timeline in response to the federal government delay in its decision. Under the preliminary timeline, construction was scheduled to begin in September 2020 to enable work to occur primarily during the winter season to take advantage of frozen ground conditions for access to and along the pipeline rights-of-way.
Assuming a decision prior to Oct. 19, 2020, the revised construction schedule is expected to provide up to six per cent of project capacity by April 2021, increasing to as much as 12 per cent of capacity in September-October 2021 and up to 37 per cent in December 2021. The remaining project capacity is expected to be available in March-April 2022.

Comment Process To Resume On Phillips Canada Complaint About Keystone Proposed Variable Tolls | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) says it has decided to recommence the comment process that was suspended earlier this year, related to a Dec. 20, 2019 complaint from Phillips 66 Canada Ltd. about a proposed 22.5 per cent increase in 2020 variable tolls on the Keystone pipeline system.
The CER also denied a Sept. 3. 2020 request from TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd. that it dismiss the Phillips complaint which was supported by Husky Oil Operations Limited and Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC (CRRM). Suncor Energy Inc. later commented in support of Phillips’s position.  
In a Nov. 29, 2019 application, Keystone had sought CER approval for the proposed tolls.  The commission in a Dec. 27 order suspended the application and made the existing tolls interim effective Jan. 1, 2020. The CER also established a comment process in regard to the Phillips complaint that Keystone had not provided sufficient information to support the significant toll increases.
Keystone subsequently proposed that the commission suspend the current process to allow parties to enter into commercial settlement discussions to effectively mirror the settlement process that was underway at that time at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to Keystone’s toll filing on the United States segment of the pipeline.
The CER suspended the comment process and any subsequent consideration of the complaint pending further communications from Keystone or interested parties. It stated that Keystone’s request would not be a determination of the merits of the complaint and that its determination to suspend the comment process was without prejudice to the right of any party to renew the complaint or raise any other concerns with the commission.
In Tuesday’s ruling, the commission noted that Phillips Canada, Husky, and Suncor all supported Keystone’s request to suspend the comment process, reserving the right to renew the complaint before the CER. It also acknowledged filings from Keystone, Philips Canada and Husky that negotiations have reached an impasse.
 Keystone must file comments with the CER by noon, Calgary time Oct. 14, 2020 and Phillips Canada, Husky and CRRM must submit reply comments, if any, to the CER by noon, Calgary time, on Oct. 21, 2020.
Once all comments have been received, the commission may issue its decision on whether to dismiss the complaint or to establish a process to further consider it.

"Permit In Hand, Entrepreneur Advances Alaska-Alberta Railway | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) –– The team behind the proposed Alaska to Alberta railway aims to start prep work for construction in December, with a goal of getting the $17 billion cross-border railroad running by 2025.
Sean McCoshen, founder and chairman of the company behind the project, said he has spent $100 million on studies and engineering reports and now has private funds backing the Alaska to Alberta Railway Development Corp., or A2A Rail, to start construction. The railway will connect Fort McMurray with the Alaska Railroad southeast of Fairbanks.
“This project is extremely viable,” McCoshen, 53, said in an interview that also included A2A Rail’s finance and strategy head Robert Dove, who previously led the Carlyle Group’s infrastructure fund. “It’s a win-win for all concerned.”
The railway would extend U.S. access to Alberta’s landlocked energy resources and offer oil-and-gas producers an alternative transportation corridor at a time when pipeline projects linking the isolated area to the west coast have been delayed. The 2,750-kilometre connection that cuts across the Yukon could also fuel economic growth in the region, benefiting both Canada and the U.S.
“This rail link will be the anchor tenant of a major northern development corridor,” Calgary-based A2A said Tuesday in a statement after getting a presidential permit for the project, adding that it will serve to facilitate economic development, and provide service to rural households and other opportunities to communities in this isolated region.
The railway would create jobs and improve living standards throughout the area, and the project wouldn’t solely be focused on shipping bitumen from Alberta’s oilsands, according to McCoshen and Dove. A2A Rail plans to move general cargo, consumer goods and fuel into the geographically isolated region.
“You’ve got vast quantities of people living up north well below the poverty line,” McCoshen said. “I’m shocked that this hasn’t been done already.”
U.S. President Donald Trump granted a presidential permit on Sept. 28, two days after tweeting that he planned to green-light the cross-border project.
 “We know we have tremendous support from all political parties in the United States” along with parties in Alaska, local governments in Alberta, Northwest Territories and Yukon, McCoshen said.
A2A Rail said it still needs environmental approvals in Canada and the U.S. as well as other permits and approvals from various government levels in both countries.
McCoshen, a former private banker and lawyer, is also chief executive officer of the McCoshen Group, which owns or holds significant interests in 11 companies ranging from manufacturing to finance, a company spokesperson said. The group has an asset base of C$3.95 billion ($2.97 billion), said the spokesperson. McCoshen owns 100 per cent of the Alaska to Alberta Railway project, though he’s prepared to sell a minority stake to Indigenous groups in Alaska and Canada.
The project is estimated to provide an additional C$60 billion ($45 billion) in cumulative economic output through 2040, with the creation of more than 28,000 jobs, A2A said in the statement.

Times Of Uncertainty For Canadian Oil And Gas Production Outlook: CERI | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Industry seeks a “next new normal” in the oil and gas markets during current uncertain times, which when paired with lower commodity prices means many firms may need to permanently lower cost structures even further than they have already, says Dinara Millington, vice-president of research at the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI).
“Various oil and gas companies need to be able to be more agile to be able to ramp up and down their capabilities and the capacity to match various external conditions, whether that’s global market fundamentals or geopolitics,” she told an oil and gas production outlook webinar on Wednesday. “Companies should also ensure the capital investment cuts in 2020 do not reduce their ability to scale production in the near- to- mid-term.”
According to Millington, with COVID-19 containment measures in 187 countries limiting passenger mobility and disrupting trade and supply chains, the prediction is for 9.3 million bbls/d less global oil demand in 2020 versus 2019. While a strong rebound in the back half of 2020 (which has not yet occurred) would reduce the annual decline in oil to 6.5 million bbls/d, a second wave of the pandemic would make the decline for this year even greater.
“Whether the prices would be too low to justify greenfield expansion in the Canadian oilpatch, that would depend. What I mean by that is, that will depend on each individual producer being able to increase production while operating in the low crude-oil-price environment.”
She added: “Yes, greenfield expansion of bitumen projects traditionally have been higher on the cost-per-barrel basis among other producing basins around the world, but there are [oilsands] projects that could continue to expand their production by adding additional phases and not necessarily going for fully greenfield expansion.”
Recently, CERI released its outlook for 2020 to 2039 for the Canadian oil and gas sector.
The natural gas situation
As for natural gas, CERI expects a production increase until 2029, due to the need for gas to feed the LNG projects. After 2029, natural gas production would stabilize through the remainder of CERI’s study period. Alberta and British Columbia would supply the gas for LNG, suggests the report.
“For the LNG exporters, LNG exporters should play the long-term game,” said Millington. “While markets may be tight in the next couple of years, international natural gas prices are highly volatile. As recently as 2018, we saw LNG trading in double digits.
“The cancellation of new LNG projects may ease the oversupply in the short term, but maintaining investment could be critical to ensuring a security of supply, and preventing a natural gas crunch later in the forecast period.”
While adapting to a “lower-for-longer” global natural gas market situation may be necessary, she noted that shale gas players might see their revenues rise, providing an opportunity for the industry to consolidate through targeted merger-and-acquisition activity.
Dealing with ESG concerns
Companies need to balance short-term and long-term priorities in the face of low energy prices and the overall energy transition, Millington told the webinar.
“Many companies have been able to lower their operating costs already, and increase revenues by doing activities such as replacing older equipment, identifying sources of fugitive methane emissions, and boosting the overall energy efficiency of their projects. In times such as these of tighter margins, the benefits of these margins should increase.”
For large oil and gas producers and suppliers, a consumer and investor push for lower-carbon energy sources likely will continue, she said, and the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics will only become more prevalent and will become a regular factor of any business model in the energy sector.
“Companies should consider expanding their … asset bases or research efforts into studying biofuels, carbon sequestration and utilization, and even power treating services, so they’re better positioned for economic recovery.”
Oilsands outlook
Regarding the oilsands, CERI’s outlook for the 2020 to 2039 timeframe also presents three scenarios, the most optimistic of which sees production for mining and in situ decline by 215,000 bbls/d in 2020, with a full recovery by 2021. By the end of the decade, production would reach 3.9 million bbls/d, peaking at 4.7 million bbls/d by 2039.
As for the second scenario, oilsands production losses amount to 716,000 bbls/d in 2020, 501,000 bbls/d in 2021, and 143,000 bbls/d in 2022 onward. This scenario sees the permanent production loss of 143,000 bbls/d in the overall outlook to 2039. After the initial production hit, bitumen production grows more slowly, rising to 3.8 million bbls/d in 2030, and 4.6 million bbls/d by the end of the forecast period.
In the third, least optimistic scenario, there is a temporary loss of more than a million bbls/d in oilsands production, while the sector permanently loses almost half a million bbls/d. Projected production volume would rebound partially by 2023, eventually reaching 3.5 million bbls/d by 2030 and peaking at 4.3 million bbls/d by 2039.
Millington noted that CERI’s forecasts assume current pipeline projects, such as the Trans Mountain expansion, other pipelines’ refurbishments and the completion of Keystone XL, go ahead. She suggested that the latter project is “highly uncertain” at the moment.

Wet'suwet'en Hereditary Chiefs Challenging Coastal GasLink In Court | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation’s Coastal GasLink pipeline faces another legal challenge from Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs.
The Office of the Wet'suwet'en is in B.C. Supreme Court today asking for a judicial review that would set aside the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office’s (EAO) decision to extend the pipeline’s environmental certificate or another five years.
The extension decision is of crucial importance to the Wet'suwet'en as it represents the only opportunity for legally binding conditions to be added to Coastal GasLink's certificate in order to address adverse effects not anticipated at the time of the original assessment, said the office.
One such adverse effect is the risk of harm to Wet'suwet'en women and girls arising from the project, including an influx of temporary labour and the proximity of CGL's work camps, it said. The final report of the Inquiry of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report found a direct link between work camps for resource projects and the increase of gender-based violence in Indigenous communities, according to the Office of the Wet'suwet'en.
Three worker camps, expected to house 500 to 800 workers each, have been built or are being built in the vicinity of Wet'suwet'en communities. Overall, there will be 14 worker camps along the CGL route.
The Wet'suwet'en legal challenge also includes what it claims is Coastal GasLink’s record of persistent and ongoing non-compliance with legally binding project conditions since 2016, as evident from EAO's official record. The Wet'suwet'en argue that EAO had a legislated obligation to consider CGL's compliance record as a key factor in the decision whether to extend the project's environmental certificate.
""We are asking the court to quash Coastal GasLink's permit extension and direct the EAO to comply with their legislated duty to consider CGL's record of non-compliance and the safety of the Clans and communities in their decision-making,” said DJ Larkin, counsel for the Office of the Wet'suwet'en

"Hydrostatic Testing Pipelines Could Be Switched To Cleaner, Cheaper Alternatives: Avatar Team | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Editor's Note: This article is one in a series that will showcase final presentations from this year’s Avatar Program — an industry-wide leadership, training and collaboration forum held virtually this summer. A partnership between Beaver Drilling Ltd., the Young Pipeliners Association of Canada (YPAC) and the University of Calgary, the program was designed to advance innovative solutions to the oil and gas industry and create new business lines, and engage young professionals. These articles will run each Wednesday.
There were nine teams in total and today we feature the presentation of our fourth team. Read all the articles in this special editorial series here.

Removing the hydrostatic test and replacing it with alternative solutions could maintain safe pipelines in Canada, while also being better for the environment and more cost effective for industry, suggests one Avatar Program team’s presentation to a panel of industry experts.
Hydrostatic testing is a process used to test tanks and pipes for leaks by pressurizing the vessel or piping, and then monitoring pressurization levels. If the pressure lowers, then there is a leak within the system. In terms of oil and gas pipeline construction, according to the Avatar team’s presentation, hydrostatic testing is simply ineffective.
“We do acknowledge the test verifies if the pipe will withstand a higher pressure than it will see during operations, and it checks if the pipe performs under this higher pressure,” said Deba Eigbe, program manager, Digital Twin, at TC Energy Corporation. “However, when you statistically analyze the hydrostatic results over recent decades, data shows it’s increasingly unlikely for modern pipeline systems to fail hydro tests.
“You may be surprised to know that even pipes with material defects have passed this test. I would add that there’s an inconsistency in what the test confirms, and how pipelines in operations actually fail.”
While the test confirms material strength at weld seams, pipeline incidents typically are not due to excessive pipe fluid pressure, he said. Engineering can mitigate such risk. One reason hydrostatic testing is increasingly useless is due to significant contemporary manufacturing advancements, as well as enhancements to quality-control processes. Since pipe-welding technology has improved, Eigbe added, the test is essentially obsolete. It is also water intensive.
“Hauling billions of cubic metres of water from a water source to a field location, often times remote, increases our environmental footprint. Where required, a simple gaseous leak test is a viable replacement.”
Finally, he noted, industry already has implemented successful piloting of enhanced lifecycle quality processes, offering alternatives to hydrostatic testing. “There’s huge potential here, and that’s what really excites us to pursue this at a broader level. The sky is the limit here.
“We just have to be intentional, deliberate and collaborative with all of the different stakeholders, making sure we listen to people’s concerns, making sure we deploy a mutually beneficial approach. If we do this in a phased approach, then I think it could go as far as we want it to.”
Indeed, eliminating the test significantly reduces water consumption for pipeline construction, noted Bertus Vos, co-founder and principal engineer at BlueFox Engineering Inc.
“We believe this will become a significant global environmental responsibility of energy leaders in the future,” he said, adding reduced overall construction schedules put pipelines into service sooner and at lower installation costs, and at reduced carbon footprints by eliminate water transportation for testing and then for proper water disposal. “These reductions result in an overall improvement of our environmental performance and social licence to operate pipelines.”
Test replacement
The Avatar team proposes replacing the hydrostatic test only where applicable, according to Vos, and to be clear, he said, doing so is not always applicable.
“We propose a whole lifecycle quality management, which starts at the engineering phase and is carried through to construction, manufacturing and finally operating, so that we can improve building upon pipeline manufacturing and engineering techniques,” Vos added. “We improve the entire quality lifecycle approach.”
Michael Abate, construction engineer and Enbridge Inc., noted it is not necessarily applicable to replace this test on all older pipelines. “We think that rolling it out in a phased approach, specifically starting with pipelines operating at lower stress limits, is the best route to begin implementing this, and then progressively as we can make better decisions on pipelines it might be applicable to.”
Cost savings
To “truly display the benefits in tangible terms” of replacing hydrostatic testing, Abate and his team looked at a case study of a “typical pipeline” project segment — a 30-inch diameter natural gas transmission line that totals 32 kilometres in length (about 20 miles). A project like this has a US$7.6-million-per-mile average cost, which totals $153 million.
He said: “Looking at the project aspects that would be eliminated, we could save a significant volume of water and no truckloads with the corresponding costs. Additionally, there’d be a 14-day schedule improvement, which equates to $2.1 million in avoided labour costs.
“As mentioned, water remediation is not a requirement to all projects, but it does have a significant cost when required. Overall, $3.8 to $6.3 million can be saved, equating to 2.5 to 4.1 per cent of the total installation cost.”
Stakeholders onside
Stakeholder engagement is a key part to successfully replacing the hydrostatic test, noted Alanna Komisar, energy solutions advisor with Enbridge. Ensuring changes are implemented in partnership with stakeholders, even including voices from environmental groups, should help “smooth in these kinds of transitions” for the sector.
“In the past, individual projects have been greenlit to forgo the hydro test as an exemption,” she said. “But if we want to scale our environmental cost savings and see the benefits for more new pipeline projects, then the opportunity really hinges on our ability to collaborate in early stages of sourcing and construction across the organization and job functions.
“This is about bringing in our friends from construction engineering, codes and standards, procurement, policy, environmental activism, and, of course, our workers on the ground.”

Indigenous Alliance Plans To Invest In Keystone Welcomed By Kenney | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has welcomed Tuesday’s announcement by Natural Law Energy (NLE), an Indigenous treaty energy alliance, that it wants to pursue an equity interest in TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL pipeline and other potential related midstream and power projects.
The historic agreement between TC Energy and NLE marks another major step forward to securing Indigenous communities as true partners in energy prosperity, the premier said in a statement.
 “The vast majority of Indigenous communities in Alberta and Western Canada recognize that their economic history and destiny lie in the prudent and responsible stewardship of the resources that lie on and below their traditional lands,” he said.
“This MOU affirms the shared importance Indigenous people and Alberta’s government place on projects such as Keystone XL, which will bring the jobs and steady economic benefits to lift more people onto solid financial ground — now and for years to come,” said Kenney.
“Through a potential equity investment in Keystone XL, it’s encouraging to see Indigenous communities taking further control of their own destiny,” he said.
The Alberta government made a C$1.5 billion equity investment in Keystone XL to enable work in Canada to begin this summer. The balance of the project in 2020 and 2021 will be funded by a US$4.2 billion loan guarantee in 2021 from the Alberta government and a US$2.7 billion investment by the company. TC Energy will reimburse the government 12 months after oil is flowing through the pipeline.
The $12 billion Keystone XL pipeline will transport 830,000 bbls/d of crude from Hardisty to Steele City, Nebraska and then connect to TC Energy facilities to the United States Gulf Coast.
The project has faced regulatory and legal challenges in the U.S. despite comprehensive scientific reviews by the U.S. Department of State over the past decade that concluded the project could be built and operated in an environmentally sustainable and responsible way. Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden also has said that if elected he would withdraw the Presidential Permit issued by President Donald Trump.
This week’s announcement follows recent news of the first Indigenous investment in a major resource project, backed by the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation — a $93-million investment into the Cascade power project, a $1.5-billion natural gas-fired power plant being built near Edson.

CEPA Report Demonstrates Pipeline Industry’s Safety Record: CEO | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A new report released today by the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) indicates how safe the pipeline industry really is and, for the past five years, people and governments have realized they are the safest way to move needed energy, Chris Bloomer, CEPA chief executive officer, said in an interview.
For a separate story on the report, click here.
“In the past, safety was a huge issue in pipelines, coming off the Michigan incident [Enbridge Inc. oil spill],” he said. “For the past 10 years, we have really focused on the safety and integrity of the system.”
 “Technology has improved for analyzing inline inspection [and] learning from the mistakes that have been made.”
The rapid adoption of new technologies is accelerating across the board and through the pandemic, major companies and industries are advancing their use of big data and artificial intelligence to manage their businesses, reduce costs and improve safety, he said.
“Those are going to transform industries going forward and it's going to mean that we'll have more tools to really put our finger on how our systems are operating and where issues are,” said Bloomer. “That is the future and what you're seeing in the trends, I think, is the fact that we've learned from past incidents and technology is being incorporated a big way to make things safer.”
Inline tools, he said, gather an enormous amount of data and in taking historical data, bringing it together and analyzing it, companies can identify anomalies and be predictive when they do a new inspection. “That’s a huge step forward.”
The theme of the report is ESG (environment, social and governance) which is an extension of the safety and integrity aspect of the industry, said Bloomer. “But those are also indicators of how the industry is engaging in social responsibility and meeting their environmental requirements in a very proactive way.”
If the industry is to attract investment, it has to be engaged in ESG and to be able to demonstrate that it is a safe, sustainable industry, and that it’s an industry that can grow, he said.
Bloomer sees a strong future for pipelines with the development of a hydrogen industry in Canada.  He noted that in Europe where it is rapidly developing, “pipelines play a massive role in making that happen and it will be the same thing in Canada.”
Whether hydrogen is generated from renewables, natural gas or nuclear power, “the pipelines are going to be the ones that are going to deliver that and make it effective.”

CEPA Report Shows Improved Performance In 2019 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Members of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) upped their game in 2019, reporting a total of only nine incidents, including one significant natural gas leak and no significant liquids spills, on pipeline rights-of-way.
That was down from 25 incidents (19 natural gas and four liquids) in 2018, according to CEPA’s 2020 transmission pipeline industry performance report released today.
For a separate story discussing the report with Chris Bloomer, CEPA CEO, click here.
During the year, CEPA members safely delivered more than 1.7 billion bbls of crude oil and 5.6 tcf of natural gas on their 118,500 kilometres of pipelines in Canada.
While significant incidents were down from six (five gas and one liquids) in 2018, the association said no incident is acceptable as CEPA members — the Canadian transmission pipeline companies responsible for transporting the majority of Canada’s natural gas and oil — are committed to a goal of zero incidents, says the report.
In 2019, there were eight unplanned natural gas releases, including one which one was classified as significant because it was caused by a rupture in the pipeline which released 12.7 mmcf of gas. A total of 22.4 mmcf was released compared to 287.3 mmcf released in 2018 from CEPA member pipelines.
In the only incident on liquids pipelines rights-of-way in 2019, the 9.4 bbls that spilled was fully recovered. The previous year, 175.5 bbls were released, of which 164.2 bbls were fully recovered.
Between 2015 and 2019, metal loss was the major cause of pipeline incidents, accounting for 46 per cent of rights-of-way incidents, followed by materials, manufacturing and construction defects (16 per cent) and cracking (13 per cent).
CEPA members reported 21 incidents within facilities in 2019. Incidents that occur within a pipeline facility pose less potential threat to the public or environment because of their size and the fact that facilities have both restricted public access and leak containment systems to keep the releases within the facility, said the report.
On the employee safety side, the rate of injury increased to 0.88 per 100 full-time employees in 2019 from 0.49 in 2018, reflecting an additional 16 injuries in 2019. CEPA members are committed to zero incidents, including health and safety and every incident is thoroughly investigated and continuous improvements are made to prevent further incidents, said the report.
The number of driving incidents per million kilometres driven fell by 33 per cent to 0.71 in 2019 from 1.62 in 2015. CEPA members continue to strengthen efforts in areas such as regular driver training and work planning that help ensure workers are not fatigued and have sufficient time to travel the required distances, said the report.
The companies invested $1.5 billion in maintenance and monitoring of their Canadian pipeline systems, including conducting 2,020 integrity digs to examine pipelines for defects and to make repairs. The number varies from year to year as each company decides when and where to perform an integrity dig, based on the results of in-line inspections and according to its operations and management programs. Since 2008, CEPA member companies have conducted a total of 31,445 integrity digs.
CEPA members also conducted in-line inspection runs on 38,937 kilometres of pipelines in Canada using highly sophisticated tools such as smart pigs that examine pipelines from the inside to identify issues such as metal loss, dents and cracks that may require further investigation.
With a focus on reducing pipeline corrosion and improving pipeline inspection, leak detection and damage prevention, CEPA members in 2019 invested $10.6 million in innovative technology. Between 2015 and 2019, the companies spent more than $94.9 million in those sorts of technologies, excluding indirect expenditures on innovative technologies through member company operational budgets.
Association members also held 393 emergency response exercises, ranging in complexity from emergency drills to full-scale exercises with participation from multiple agencies and jurisdictions, and mobilization of personnel and equipment as if a real emergency had occurred.
Because safe pipeline infrastructure is vital to Canada and the world, CEPA member companies established CEPA Integrity First through which all members work collaboratively to share their knowledge and innovations with one another to drive industry-wide operating performance improvements in pipeline safety and environmental protection. CEPA members do not compete on safety, but work together to continually improve pipelines — focusing on safety, transparency and responsible operations — striving toward zero incidents.
In 2018, Integrity First was expanded to include Integrity First Partners, a membership category for natural gas and oil producing companies that operate transmission and gathering pipelines, building on the success of Integrity First to reduce risk.
Pipelines and pipeline operators, remain a vital part of the evolving energy ecosystem that Canada and the world depend on, says the report. About 71 per cent of fuel needs in Canada today are met by natural gas and oil with 92 per cent of Canada’s oil and 100 per cent of its natural gas shipped by pipeline.
As the world addresses climate change, Canada’s responsible natural gas and oil transported by pipelines will be an important part of the solution, says the report. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada can help lower global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when it’s used to displace higher-emitting fuels for power generation and will be transported to LNG terminals by pipeline.

CER Urged To Reject CNRL Bid For Dismissal Of Enbridge’s Proposed Mainline Conversion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A notice of motion from Canadian Natural Resources Limited asking the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to dismiss an Enbridge Inc. application to convert the Canadian Mainline to contract from common carriage is “devoid of merit” and “an abuse of the commission’s process,” says Enbridge.
“The commission has already determined, after receiving comments from CNRL and other interested parties, that a public hearing of the Application is required and it has established a process to consider the application that it considers to be efficient and proportionate,” says the company in response to the CNRL filing.
“Had the commission concluded, on the basis of the comments it received, that there was no merit to the application and thus no genuine issue to be tried, the commission would not have established a process to deal with the application in the first place.”
As grounds for its motion, Canadian Natural argued that the application is contrary to the CER filing manual and that the proposed conversion to firm from carriage service is contrary to the CER Act and unjustly discriminatory.  
In its filing, Enbridge said the two grounds are “baseless,” describing them as a “blatant attempt by CNRL to re-litigate matters that have already been raised and determined by the commission.”
CNRL has argued that because Enbridge is not seeking approval of a negotiated settlement pursuant to the National Energy Board Revised Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements of Traffic, Tolls and Tariffs, it must be regulated by the commission on a cost of service basis, says the pipeline operator. “This conclusion is incorrect and has already been found by the commission to be incorrect.”
Enbridge says the courts have confirmed that the CER has been given statutory authority in the broadest terms with respect to all matters relating to tolls, and that it is not required to adopt any specific methodology in determining tolls. “The commission cannot lawfully fetter its discretion and refuse to consider an application for approval of tolls that are other than cost-of-service based.”
In seeking dismissal of the Enbridge application, CNRL also had argued that implementing firm service on the Mainline is contrary to the common carrier provisions in the CER Act.  However, CNRL made that argument earlier and it was before the commission when it established the hearing process in which it determined it would not consider on a preliminary basis the appropriateness of converting the Canadian Mainline to largely committed service from exclusively uncommitted service, says Enbridge.

"TC Energy, Natural Law Energy Sign MOU For Indigenous Equity Investments | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
TC Energy Corporation and Natural Law Energy (NLE) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for NLE to pursue an equity interest in the Keystone XL project and other potential related midstream and power projects.
A final agreement between TC Energy and NLE is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, formalizing NLE’s participation in the Keystone XL project.
 “Today’s announcement is a testament to what we can accomplish when industry and Indigenous groups work together,” said Chief Alvin Francis, president of NLE. “This historic agreement is an important step for our peoples and future generations to share in the energy wealth coming from our lands and traditional territories.”
NLE CEO Travis Meguinis stated: “This very substantial and historic agreement has been reached through the practice of traditional protocols involving our grassroot chiefs and leaders. All the chiefs, NLE and TC Energy worked hard to develop a path for all First Nations and industry to follow. This partnership is historic and one of the largest ever of its kind in Canada and around Turtle Island (North America).”
Support for the MOU comes from the elected leaders of five First Nations in Alberta and Saskatchewan:

Maskwacis Nations (AB);
Ermineskin Cree Nation;
Montana First Nation;
Louis Bull Tribe;
Saddle Lake Cree Nation (AB);
Nekaneet First Nation (SK).

“This MOU, which is one of the first of its kind for TC Energy with Indigenous communities, is a reflection of our commitment to working together to ensure Indigenous groups share the benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline over the long term as a valuable partner,” said Richard Prior, president, Keystone XL. “Our goal was not to just build relationships with Indigenous groups along our right-of-way, but to build trusted partnerships.
“We will work closely with Natural Law Energy and its members to facilitate Indigenous ownership in our future projects not only because it makes good business sense but because it’s the right thing to do for our Liquids Business Unit. We aspire to expand this model into future opportunities for other Indigenous groups along our Keystone XL right-of-way both in Canada and the Unites States.”

Inter Pipeline To Acquire Milk River Pipeline System | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Inter Pipeline Ltd. will acquire the Milk River pipeline system from Plains Midstream Canada ULC in exchange for its 100 per cent ownership interest in the Empress II and 50 per cent ownership interest in the Empress V straddle plants.
Plains will also pay Inter Pipeline cash proceeds of $35 million. Closing of this transaction is expected to occur in early 2021 following completion of customary conditions.
""This transaction is expected to be accretive to funds from operations and provide meaningful operational and commercial synergies with our existing conventional oil transportation business"" said Christian Bayle, president and chief executive officer of Inter Pipeline. ""The Milk River pipeline system has a natural alignment with our Bow River system and this acquisition will improve our access to the Montana refining region, an important delivery market for Inter Pipeline and our customers.""
The Milk River pipeline system is comprised of two 16-kilometre pipelines with current throughput volume of approximately 90,000 bbls/d and links Inter Pipeline's Bow River pipeline system from Milk River, Alberta to the U.S./Canadian border west of Coutts, Alberta. The transaction also includes pumping and metering facilities, two crude oil storage tanks and truck unloading facilities.
Approximately 90 per cent of the volume that flows through the Milk River pipeline today originates from the Bow River system and Inter Pipeline will receive incremental cash flow from both tariff revenue and marketing activities. This pipeline system is expected to generate approximately $25 million of annual EBITDA.
The Empress II and Empress V straddle plants are geographically remote compared to Inter Pipeline's core natural gas liquids processing assets. These two straddle plants, currently operated by Plains, are located near Empress, Alberta on the eastern leg of the TC Energy Corporation Alberta System.

Saskatchewan Supports Indigenous Participation In Pipeline Projects | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Saskatchewan’s Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison announced $1 million in provincial funding this week to support Indigenous participation in Saskatchewan’s natural resource sector.
This funding will support two projects that will conduct dialogue and promote Indigenous involvement with resource industries.
“We are committed to advancing pipeline projects that will build a strong energy sector, strong Indigenous communities, and a strong Saskatchewan,” Harrison said. “That is why we have formed the Pipeline Projects Assessment Committee to work with our partners and support pipeline projects with significant Indigenous involvement.”
This funding will help to achieve Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan goals to increase the value of Saskatchewan’s exports by 50 per cent by 2030, expand export infrastructure and to grow Indigenous participation in Saskatchewan’s natural resource industries.
The Peacemaker Project, led by the First Peoples Pipeline, will receive a total of $500,000 to further work on a proposed project to create a new energy corridor for western Canadian oil and gas to an export terminal near Churchill, Man. Funding of $250,000 was provided in March 2020, with the additional $250,000 to be provided this fall.
The project will provide the opportunity for Indigenous communities to engage in profit sharing using an ownership structure throughout the life of the project, while western Canadian oil and gas producers would have world market access through the new energy corridor and a northern tidewater port.
“This pipeline presents a significant economic opportunity for Indigenous communities to become more involved in our western Canadian energy sector and to increase market access for Saskatchewan products,” First Peoples Pipeline director Blaine Favel said. “First Peoples Pipeline appreciates this support from the Government of Saskatchewan, which will help us continue to work to develop this project.”
Project Reconciliation, delivered by the Indian Resource Council of Canada (IRC), will receive $500,000 to focus on promoting Indigenous participation and ownership in the Trans Mountain pipeline and expansion project and other major energy infrastructure projects.
“The Government of Saskatchewan’s financial commitment signifies a radical new approach to resource development and Indigenous economic participation in Canada; one which acknowledges that all levels of governments and Indigenous people work together to create sustainable Indigenous wealth, well-being and economic sovereignty, while fostering responsible development on our traditional lands,” Project Reconciliation executive chairman and founder Delbert Wapass said.
“These efforts supporting an economic framework for Indigenous ownership in large infrastructure projects provides a win-win for our people, industry, government and the environment. Project Reconciliation appreciates the financial support from the Government of Saskatchewan that helps facilitate moving this project to the next level, while laying the foundation for additional investments benefitting Indigenous people and all Canadians.”
“The IRC continues to advocate for increased participation of Indigenous people in the energy sector as well as supporting Indigenous ownership of TMX and other major projects,” IRC president and CEO Stephen Buffalo said. “The funding support from Saskatchewan will help Project Reconciliation get their message to folks on the ground and hopefully make this project and others a reality for the economic betterment of Indigenous people.”

TECUMSEH: A New Approach To Collaboration Between Industry And Indigenous Canadians | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Editor's Note: This article is one in a series that will showcase final presentations from this year’s Avatar Program — an industry-wide leadership, training and collaboration forum held virtually this summer. A partnership between Beaver Drilling Ltd., the Young Pipeliners Association of Canada (YPAC) and the University of Calgary, the program was designed to advance innovative solutions to the oil and gas industry and create new business lines, and engage young professionals. These articles will run each Wednesday.
There were nine teams in total and today we feature the presentation of our third team. Read all the articles in this special editorial series here.

A secure and easy-to-use digital platform designed for collaboration between First Nations communities and oil and gas companies would effectively strengthen industry engagement with Indigenous Canadians, according to one Avatar Program presentation, and ‘TECUMSEH’ is the proposed name for that platform.
“Logging in and uploading information will be as easy as updating your Facebook or LinkedIn, but as secure as your banking app,” said Kaella-Marie Earle, an engineer-in-training with Enbridge Gas Inc. and a member of the team presenting this digital-platform concept to a panel of industry expert judges. “The TECUMSEH approach focuses on early engagement centred around reciprocal data capture and sharing.”
According to Earle, who is from the Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory, TECUMSEH would be equipped with three main measures, including an elevated method for accessible project communication, leveraging existing digital resources such as geospatial data and drone technology, to allow operators and individual Indigenous nations to work together on the design of a custom consultation and permitting process, saving both time and money.
The second measure uses cloud technology to help the oil and gas industry both build capacity of Indigenous communities and leverage the growing Indigenous economy in procurement and supply-chain strategies. The third measure acts as a “highly-secured cloud-based data collaboration platform” for Indigenous people to collect cultural information that they alone would own and access, sharing at the discretion of the communities.
Earle said: “There’s a growing trend of improved engagement and inclusion of Indigenous peoples at all levels of business from multiple key players in the industry. There’s also a significant increase in Indigenous entrepreneurship and community cultural resurgence.”
On average, the midstream pipeline approval process takes five years, noted Jil Macdonald, director of enterprise artificial intelligence integration at AltaML Inc., and Canadian Energy Regulator (CER) data shows that there are 15,000 unique interaction points between project proponents and First Nations during the approval and construction phases. TECUMSEH would streamline those interactions by seven to 10 per cent.
“Using a recent Canadian pipeline as an example, this would result in the pipeline coming online 125 days earlier, accelerating the transportation of 66 million barrels, providing an economic impact of $3.7 billion,” she said, adding establishment of strong Indigenous relations prior to project initiation enhances trust and knowledge sharing between parties, enabling First Nations and industry to be aware of active energy projects and of the economic opportunities.
“Our approach would decrease consultation fatigue for Indigenous groups, and mitigate unforeseen costs and time overruns for companies.”





Four-phase approach
Gary Sangha, a supply-chain analyst at TC Energy Corporation, said his Avatar team envisions a four-phase TECUMSEH implementation approach, beginning by developing strategic relationships with specific industry partners while also building out a platform structure consisting of factual and verified industry and Indigenous data.
“Via collaboration with industry, we will identify the data inputs required for our platform, and build the various applications that’ll be used to assist in the consulting and relationship building with Indigenous peoples,” he said, adding the focus would then be on refining his team’s concept via a scalable approach, which ultimately would involve a pilot development involving midstream, government, regulatory and Indigenous partners.
Testing various technologies and data inputs on the platform before releasing all three of the applications is key to developing TECUMSEH, said Sangha. Collaboration is the platform’s top value. “Now more than ever we need a data-sharing platform to advance our industry for building relationships with Indigenous peoples. There is simply no Indigenous relations platform that pools multiple data sources and applications into one platform like we do.”
Companies will use their own resources and talent to build Indigenous data inputs and centralized, multifaceted technology into one platform through this scalable approach, he noted, resulting in a low-cost and low-risk business model for these stakeholders.
Technology to the rescue
The implementation of advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles as part of the digital platform, as well as GIS mapping and various other tools, can improve the efficiency of TECUMSEH, according to Richard Gunn, project manager at TC Energy.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean less communication, but communication that’s very efficient, effective and really gives a clear vision of what the proposed project [means] to Indigenous communities.”
Certain technologies currently in the piloting stage include weather balloon-style devices that give satellite-type connectivity, thus facilitating the TECUMSEH approach for remote Indigenous communities, noted Chris Piercey, urban demand advisor at Enbridge Inc.
“And so, there has been thought [put] into potentially having some of our funding go to being able to get some of these businesses or communities online as well. It’s more or less built in to what we’re asking and what we’re projecting.”
Sangha said his team’s proposed platform brings together industry as one team, facilitating collaboration and innovation via a single-source “truth platform” as companies strive to reduce operational risk and cost, while also building long-term relationships with Indigenous peoples.
As for the ‘TECUMSEH’ moniker, Earle told the Bulletin that name refers to a 19th Century Shawnee Indigenous leader, known for unifying different tribes. As for Earle, she was named recently to an Indigenous advisory committee that will work hand-in-hand with the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) board of directors.

Producers Disagree On Need For Temporary Service Protocol Extension | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A proposed extension to a temporary tariff provision giving interruptible (IT) shippers on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) System summer access to storage faces opposition from some firm shippers as well as from NGTL.  
The Transportation Temporary Service Protocol (TSP), approved a year ago by the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), is to expire Oct. 31, 2020.
The Explorers and Producers of Canada (EPAC) in an application to the regulator has asked that the TSP be extended by one year to Oct. 31, 2021, or until the NGTL 2021 system expansion receives leave to open, whichever is first. It argues that the extension is necessary because of a delay in the expansion in-service date resulting from the federal cabinet’s deferral of a decision on the project.
 (NGTL has indicated that if the project receives federal approval in October, up to six per cent of the 1.45 bcf/d of project capacity would be in service for the April 1, 2021, start of the summer gas season).
The EPAC application has attracted considerable industry interest with more than 30 submissions to the regulator, with a near-even split between those in favour and those opposed.
Companies opposed to the EPAC application and in support of the NGTL position say the extension, which was supposed to be temporary, would prioritize access to storage and access to interruptible transportation over firm transportation service, potentially skewing market signals and potentially affecting long-term contracting on the NGTL System.
However, those in favour, including Tourmaline Oil Corp. and the Alberta government, voice concern that without the extension, natural gas producers could again experience price volatility should there be production growth or maintenance projects on the system next summer.
“Altering the priority of service harms the tariff’s core principle of cost-based/user pay,” says Chevron Corporation, which objects to the EPAC request. “Such an alteration will negatively impact commercial commitments made by shippers that were premised on the reasonable expectation of receiving firm transportation services.”
In its filing, the company says the proposed extension would transform the TSP from a temporary, short term protocol into a long term redesign of the tariff and harm the priority of service as set out in the tariff.
Canadian Natural Resources Limited, the second largest shipper by volume on the NGTL System, says it has been affected by the TSP and strongly opposes the EPAC application, urging the CER to dismiss it without further process.
The protocol directly affects the value of holding both firm receipt and delivery (FT-R and FT-D) contracts under the current NGTL System service design as interruptible (IT) shippers that have taken no financial risk are given priority at the expense of FT shippers who have made financial commitments to the NGTL System, says the company.
Continued operation of the protocol is “very likely” to precipitate de-contracting of FT-D service on the NGTL System which in turn could affect the amount of FT-R contracting, according to CNRL. It also potentially could eliminate reliable market signals with respect to future NGTL expansions in eliminating the incentive to hold FT-D capacity.
CNRL points out that NGTL has recently informed shippers that it anticipates that the first tranche of capacity expansion under the 2021 NGTL system expansion project will be available by April 2021, in time for the start of the summer gas season. “If this occurs, further operational flexibility beyond that gained since April 2019 will be available on the NGTL System,” it says.
In arguing against the extension, Murphy Canada Ltd. says it believes the approval of the proposed application and any extension of TSP will negatively affect the natural gas industry in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin by increasing uncertainty for parties contemplating long-term capital investments. “Such increased uncertainty will negatively impact the competitiveness and development of both supply and demand infrastructure,” it says.
According to Murphy, the proposed application could have significant effects on its operations and business and may lead to decreases in its and other similarly situated shippers’ natural gas production by altering the contractual rights and priorities related to IT and FT services.
In their submissions, Ovintiv Canada ULC, NuVista Energy Ltd.  and Seven Generations Energy Ltd. simply urge the CER to dismiss the application on the grounds that it provides no basis for the commission to either conduct a review of the decision approving the TSP or to make an order extending the expiry date under its general powers relating to toll and tariff matters with respect to the matter.
Imperial Oil Resources Limited, ExxonMobil Canada Energy and XTO Energy Canada also oppose the extension, arguing that it no longer is needed. The submission notes that when the TSP was implemented access to storage through interruptible transportation was limited. However, since April 2019 approximately one bcf/d of system capacity has been added along with additional operational flexibility, it says.

In its submission in support of the EPAC application, Tourmaline says the extension mitigates the risk of volatility and enhances access to storage should the need arise in the summer of 2021.
While recently completed 2020 expansions have helped increase capacity on the NGTL System, without the NGTL 2021 expansion in service, “returning to the pre-TSP curtailment process [of IT access to storage] could result in shippers once again facing capacity constraints and difficulty accessing storage in the summer months,” it says.
“Shippers could face a 2021 summer season burdened not only with normal-business related planned outages/maintenance periods but also those delayed from 2020 which are required to put the 2021 expansion in place,” warns Tourmaline.
Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. in its submission of support for the extension also suggests that NGTL’s concern that extending TSP would skew market signals and increase the risk of decontracting of firm delivery contracts is unwarranted, especially given that each of NGTL’s most recent open seasons for firm capacity have been over-subscribed. Approval of the application, it says, would provide the company with the option to potentially access the storage market for gas production it had initially intended to ship under contracted firm delivery contracts with NGTL which it can no longer accommodate due to the announced delays.
An extension of the TSP also would provide necessary reassurance for market participants and capital markets, according to Longshore Resources Ltd. “These weak AECO prices of the last several years have imposed financial hardship on Canadian natural gas producers,” it says. “If weak and volatile AECO prices return next summer, this would once again inflict unnecessary damage to the struggling Canadian natural gas sector.”
In its submission supporting the extension, the government of Alberta says the TSP has worked as intended since the commission granted approval and continues to be a reasonable short-term solution in the interests of the overall NGTL System. It says it continues to be concerned about access to storage and markets as described in the RH-002-2019 proceeding, including potential impacts to price volatility.
The government acknowledges that recent capacity additions have created additional operational flexibility on the system, reducing the use of the TSP during the summer of 2020. “This additional operational flexibility highlights the importance and impact of additional system capacity on access to storage and markets, which Alberta submits will further improve when the 2021 expansion facilities are in service,” it says. “In the interim, the TSP will be useful to prevent unnecessary limitations to storage access or markets, ensuring system usage is optimized during the TSP-eligible outages.”

PowerChina Eyes Rail Project To Transport Oil And Gas From Argentina’s Vaca Muerta | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — A Chinese energy company is in talks to build a billion-dollar railway in Argentina that would move crude oil and natural gas from the massive Vaca Muerta shale region to the port city of Bahia Blanca, its president for Argentina said on Thursday.
PowerChina is in talks with Argentina's state-owned rail entity ADIF for the line, which would act as a crucial link between the isolated shale region and the petrochemical and refinery hub, Tu Shuiping, president of PowerChina in Argentina, said in an interview.
""There is a concrete plan that we have been working on for almost two years. We were talking with people from ADIF to see how the project can be presented and then seek joint financing,"" Tu said.
Cash-strapped Argentina, which is mired in recession and default, has struggled to capitalize on Vaca Muerta, one of world's largest reserves of shale oil and gas. To continue growing, Vaca Muerta needs greater investment in exploration and production, as well as pipelines, storage terminals, and railways to transport crude and gas.
The project's cost is estimated between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, Tu said, adding that China could provide the financing.
A spokesman for Argentina's ministry of transportation said ""there is dialogue with many companies"" for Vaca Muerta infrastructure but that plans, at the moment, are undefined. The rail line could also be used to ship sand for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and food, Tu said.
Plans for the line stalled over a lack of financing options under the administration of Mauricio Macri, Tu said, but the project appears to be moving forward under the government of President Alberto Fernandez.
PowerChina has 14 active projects in Argentina, including the largest solar park in South America, located in Jujuy province.

Revised Construction Schedule Set For NGTL 2021 Expansion Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) has revised its construction schedule for its proposed NGTL 2021 expansion after the federal cabinet said it would delay a decision on it until no later than Oct. 19, 2020.
Under the preliminary timeline, pipeline construction was scheduled to begin in September 2020 to enable construction activities to occur primarily during the winter season to take advantage of frozen ground conditions for access to and along the pipeline right-of-ways.
In a notice to its customers, the company says the revised construction schedule is expected to provide up to six per cent of the 1.45 bcf/d of project capacity by April 2021, increasing to as much as 12 per cent of capacity in September-October 2021 and up to 37 per cent in December 2021. The remaining project capacity is expected to be available in March-April 2022.
However, these anticipated facility in-service dates and associated capacities are estimates only and assume a cabinet decision no later than Oct. 19, 2020, says NGTL. “The actual facility in-service dates and capacities may vary and continue to be dependent upon when GIC approval is received, completion of compliance, the detailed routing process and potential impacts to the construction schedule such as seasonal conditions,” it says.
In February 2020, the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER) issued its recommendation report for the project, finding it to be in the public interest and recommending that the governor-in-council approve the project. Although the legislated timeline for GIC review prior to releasing a decision is 90 days from the issuance of the CER report, the cabinet extended the decision timeline by up to 150 days. 
NGTL said it continues to engage with the government to advocate the criticality of a timely approval to enable construction of the facilities and provide the essential capacity required to serve incremental transportation contracts and meet the growing demand for natural gas sourced from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB).
In anticipation of cabinet approval, the company said it continues to refine and optimize the project’s construction schedule to minimize the schedule and cost impacts resulting from the delay.
Once approval is received, NGTL is required to clear pre-construction conditions and complete the detailed routing process with the CER. Completing these requirements typically takes approximately 60 to 90 days.
NGTL said it is now planning and preparing to initiate construction activities on the compressor stations to start in December 2020 and continue through to in-service. Early pipeline construction activities such as clearing, grading and horizontal directional drilling work is planned to begin in January 2021 with full construction following spring breakup due to ground conditions.

Dakota Access Oil Pipe Likely Safe From Shutdown Through 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– The Dakota Access oil pipeline is poised to stay in service at least through December under a new court schedule, assuming the Trump administration doesn’t force a shutdown.
Under the proposed briefing schedule filed Wednesday, a federal court in Washington won’t be prepared to rule until late December, at the earliest, on a renewed bid to halt the line.
The proposed schedule would give tribes opposed to the Dakota Access until Oct. 16 to file a new request to shutter it. Lawyers for the Army Corps of Engineers and pipeline operator Energy Transfer LP would have until Nov. 20 to respond, and the tribes would have until Dec. 18 for final briefs.
The Army Corps is still reviewing whether it should order removal of the pipeline after the court scrapped a federal easement for the line, which delivers crude oil from North Dakota shale fields to an Illinois hub.

New Energy Future: Avatar Team Recommends Blending Hydrogen Onto Coastal GasLink | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Editor's Note: This article is one in a series that will showcase final presentations from this year’s Avatar Program — an industry-wide leadership, training and collaboration forum held virtually this summer. A partnership between Beaver Drilling Ltd., the Young Pipeliners Association of Canada (YPAC) and the University of Calgary, the program was designed to advance innovative solutions to the oil and gas industry and create new business lines, and engage young professionals. These articles will run each Wednesday.
There were nine teams in total and today we feature the presentation of our second team; last week we highlighted the winning submission. Read all the articles in this special editorial series here.

Hydrogen provides an opportunity for energy companies to innovate, diversify and attract new investments, and blending hydrogen gas into existing pipelines would let producers quickly access lucrative West Coast and overseas markets.
According to the team of young professionals pitching this idea to industry leaders as part of the Avatar Program, investing in hydrogen also allows Alberta and Ottawa to be in sync regarding energy development and environmental policy.
There are three different types of hydrogen: grey, blue and green.
Grey hydrogen is produced using fossil fuels such as natural gas, which emit CO2 into the air as they combust. Blue hydrogen is made the same way, but carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) helps make it cleaner. As its name suggests, green hydrogen is the cleanest variety and is produced when renewable energy is used in the electrolysis process that removes the hydrogen.
“Federal policy and financial support will open the door to build up the hydrogen industry within Canada,” said team member Lindsay Drozdiak, a mechanical design engineer. “We must act now on the export opportunities that lay in regions such as Japan, Korea, China and California, who’ve already developed aggressive hydrogen targets for 2030 and 2050. We need to play a role in fulfilling that demand.”
She added: “By utilizing existing infrastructure, we need to act quickly and jump on this export opportunity while paving the path forward for Canada’s domestic hydrogen economy.”
Canada produces hydrogen through steam methane reforming (SMR) via petrochemical refining within Alberta’s Industrial Heartland, with the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL) available for CO2 disposal.
Blending that hydrogen into the Coastal GasLink pipeline would enable producers to access B.C.’s coast at Kitimat — a single distribution point for H2 that is provincially regulated and approved, with the possibility of increased capacity.
The Coastal GasLink pipeline is an approximately 670 kilometre pipeline from the Dawson Creek area of B.C. to the West Coast. Currently under construction, the line will transport natural gas to the approved LNG Canada project near Kitimat.
Mark Fukuda, account manager at Spartan Control Ltd., said there are no major infrastructure upgrades required on the pipeline when using a five-per-cent blend ratio.
Once at Kitimat, the team says, hydrogen should be separated from the blend using a membrane process that is simple, energy efficient, and costs less than other available options.
“Hydrogen separation using membranes requires less than 50 per cent of the energy required from other methods, and carbon membranes require less energy compared to polymer membranes,” said John Martínez, an engineer with degrees from the National University of Colombia and University of Calgary. “Another advantage is that they can separate hydrogen from streams with as low as five per cent H2.”
Available markets
Canadian-produced blue hydrogen has a nearby available market in California, with the state targeting one million fuel-cell vehicles by 2030, said Kaylyn Tenove, a system design engineer at Enbridge Inc. Also, she added, shipping hydrogen to Kitimat provides a domestic market as B.C. drives policies to stimulate demand. There is also Asia.
“Japan leads the way in Asia, with targets to have 62 million fuel-cell vehicles and 53 million households powered by hydrogen in 2050,” she told a panel of industry leaders during last month’s final Avatar event. “By 2050, hydrogen demand in California and Japan, South Korea and China is anticipated to reach 100 million tonnes per year. Just a five-per-cent share of these markets could be worth $15 billion annually.”
While Australia is well positioned for these markets, noted Tenove, that country is unable to meet all the demand in Asia and California, and Canadian hydrogen can compete with Australia, even with liquefaction and shipping costs.
“Plus, it’s anticipated our production costs become lower as we start to see the economies of scale when hydrogen starts to grow. If we can provide a security of supply and Canadian hydrogen to these markets before our competitors, then there’s the potential for a major export opportunity.”
West Coast access to these leading markets puts Canada in a good position to export blue hydrogen.
Souvik Neogi, a professional engineer with more than 12 years of experience, noted that the distance from B.C. to Japan is the same as from Australia to Japan. “If we can get into Japan, it would be a really big advantage for us.”
Peace Region advantage
Construction of SMR facilities in the Peace Region coupled with CCUS offers potential to deploy large-scale hydrogen production that can expand Canada’s hydrogen sector and meet increasing market demand domestically and abroad, according to Thomas Xi, a data scientist at Enbridge. “The future of hydrogen is a great opportunity for Canada.”
British Columbia has abundant natural gas reserves to produce hydrogen, geologic potential from its depleted gas reservoirs and saline aquifers enabling roughly 3,000 megatonnes of CO2 storage per year, market proximity, access to hydrogen production technologies, world-class academic institutions supporting the clean-tech sector, and a provincial government willing to help fund private-sector development of necessary infrastructure in the Peace Region, he added.
“All of these competitive advantages make the Peace Region ideal for acceleration of the hydrogen economy in Canada. The maximum hydrogen production through SMR and CCS in Peace Region can be estimated at 1.1 million tonnes per year, which can be expected [to fulfil] 9.79 per cent of market demand by 2030.”

CER Should Dismiss Enbridge Mainline Firm Transportation Bid: CNRL | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Canadian Natural Resources Limited is urging the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to dismiss Enbridge Inc.’s application to allow it to convert its Canadian Mainline transportation service to firm service from the current carriage service.
 In a notice of motion, CNRL says it would be “just and reasonable” to dismiss the application at this stage. The company says it expects that any such dismissal would be without prejudice to Enbridge’s ability to attempt to negotiate a settlement that meets the requirements of the Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements or file a new tolling application based on cost-of-service principles.
The application should be denied summarily on the basis that Enbridge has not filed its application under the Guidelines of Negotiated Settlements nor was it developed on a cost-of-service basis, CNRL submits. It also argues that Enbridge’s proposed conversion to firm service is contrary to section 239 (1) of the CER Act and unjustly discriminatory and therefore contrary to section 235 of the act.
 “It is clear from the record that Enbridge is attempting to abuse its market power as no company in a competitive business would proceed with such a proposal in the face of so much opposition from its customers. Its customers would simply go elsewhere,” says CNRL in setting out its grounds for dismissal.
Enbridge has argued that shippers want guaranteed access through the Enbridge system, as well as toll stability.
Canadian producers, though, must use the Mainline for the majority of their production and producers bear the toll in the netback price whether they pay the toll directly to Enbridge or not, CNRL's filing says. “While the application is supported by refiners who represent the shippers of record for approximately 70 per cent of the volumes shipped on the Mainline, it is indisputable that all of that oil being shipped is provided by producers in the WCSB.”
 The supply provided by these producers enables Enbridge to exist and producers are clearly essential elements in Enbridge’s business, CNRL points out. “No business operating in a competitive environment would attempt to foist such a proposal on its customers in the face of such significant opposition.”
In an earlier ruling, in response to information requests from interveners about cost of service,  the commission directed Enbridge to provide the information outlined in Guide P of the National Energy Board filing manual “in a manner and form that is consistent with Guide P” and consolidated in a single submission.  Enbridge has since done so.
Based on the application and the additional filed information, CNRL says the commission can now make the necessary findings of fact to make a determination. “Doing so now by summarily dismissing the application will avoid the unnecessary strain on the limited regulatory resources of parties,” it says.
“In particular, the vast majority of producers and other stakeholders who are opposed to the application will not be required to incur the significant expenses and drain on human resources required to participate in further rounds of information requests and an oral hearing,” CNRL adds. “This is a particularly important fairness and public interest consideration when one considers the exceptional circumstances currently facing the Canadian oil producing industry.”
The Enbridge application has faced opposition from a number of other parties including Suncor Energy Inc. and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) although it has the support of Cenovus Energy Inc., along with a number of refineries.

"Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion On Schedule, Budget After One Year, CEO Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(The Canadian Press) –– A year after construction was allowed to restart on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, its chief executive says the project is on budget and on schedule for completion by the end of 2022.
The project is advancing as expected despite challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic, a global slump in demand for fuel, a $5.2-billion rise in its estimated cost to $12.6 billion in February and ongoing protests by opponents, said CEO Ian Anderson in an interview.
The expansion project is designed to triple the capacity of the existing pipeline between Edmonton and a shipping terminal in Burnaby, B.C., to about 890,000 bbls/d of products including diluted bitumen, lighter crudes and refined fuels such as gasoline.
“We've got some major elements of the project to still do, but they're all on track and there's no critical path items I'm worried about at this point,” said Anderson. “We're making great progress.”
Opponents, however, remain resolute.
“Given the economic circumstances in the country vis-a-vis COVID and the collapsing pricing in oil and gas, there’s absolutely no way that the Trans Mountain pipeline project is anywhere near viable or feasible,'' said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs.
He said he thinks the federal government, which bought the pipeline and its expansion project for $4.5 billion in 2018, is waiting for the expansion to “collapse under its own weight of economic uncertainties.''
More opposition on the ground will swell as construction moves farther into the B.C. Interior, Phillip said, adding he expects “Burnaby Mountain-style” protests like those that resulted in more than 100 people being arrested after they camped out in a conservation area in 2014 to block pipeline crews.
Trans Mountain has continued to enlist the support of Indigenous people on the pipeline route and has now signed agreements with 68 communities, Anderson said, leaving “a handful” that aren't on board. He said the holdouts aren't expected to prevent or delay the pipeline.
Authorities have been swift to act on a court injunction against civil disobedience, he added, noting he's satisfied that will allow the company to continue unimpeded by opposition.
“We’ve got some up a tree in Burnaby right now, we’ve got an individual up protesting in a tree, but they're not inhibiting any work, they’re not getting in the way of any of our safe work and safety of our workers,”  he said, adding peaceful protesters are welcome.
A group of environmentalists have been taking turns occupying treetops in Burnaby since early August to protest the pipeline's route through a conservation area.
The existing pipeline ran at full capacity at the height of the pandemic's dampening impact on North American fuel demand, unlike competing export oil pipelines such as Enbridge Inc.’s Mainline system, Anderson said, a fact he attributed to its ability to reach diverse markets in B.C., overseas and in the United States.
Calgary-based Cenovus Energy Inc. used Trans Mountain this summer to collect oil from Alberta to fill an oil tanker in Burnaby and ship it through the Panama Canal to an Irving Oil Limited refinery on the other side of the country in Saint John.
Anderson says that feat hasn't been duplicated since, but it illustrates the ability of the pipeline system to access new markets when the expansion is completed for its 13 contracted shippers.
“We will increasingly see movements to China and Southeast Asia, I expect, as that market opens up. Right now, producers have very limited access to it because we've got such limited capabilities of moving oil onto those tankers,'' he said.
He added the project is about 15 per cent complete now and is expected to be at 30 per cent by year-end.

Pennsylvania Orders Sunoco To Reroute Section Of Mariner East 2 NGL Pipe | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Pennsylvania environmental regulators ordered Energy Transfer LP’s Sunoco Pipeline unit to reroute a section of the Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline after spilling 8,000 gallons of drilling fluid in Marsh Creek State Park in August.
Analysts at Height Capital Markets said on Monday the reroute could delay an upgrade to the already operating Mariner East 2 project that was expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021.
Officials at Energy Transfer were not immediately available for comment.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said late Friday the Marsh Creek spill caused the park to close 33 acres (13 hectares) of the lake from boating and other recreational uses.
“These incidents are yet another instance where Sunoco has blatantly disregarded the citizens and resources of Chester County with careless actions while installing the Mariner East II Pipeline,"" DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in a statement.
The reroute order was the latest in a long series of sanctions against the company for violations of its permits during construction of Mariner East 2.
Since May 2017, Pennsylvania has issued 115 notices of violation to Mariner East, mostly for drilling fluid spills, including one in September.
Pennsylvania has fined the company and stopped construction on the pipe several times. Several politicians and local groups have long urged the state to stop work again and shut the pipe.
Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia.
Sunoco started work on the $2.5 billion Mariner East expansion in February 2017 and had planned to finish the 563-kilometre pipeline in the third quarter of 2017.
But completion was delayed until December 2018 due to several work stoppages by state agencies.

Enbridge To Resume Operation Of Line 5’s East Segment | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc. says it will restart the east segment of Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac after receiving authorization from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and approval from the Michigan Circuit Court.
Following a review of the data from an in-line inspection of the east segment in the area around the damaged screw anchor, PHMSA indicated in a letter to Enbridge dated Sept. 4, 2020, that: “The review by PHMSA and its independent third-party expert did not identify any integrity issues. As no integrity issues have been identified in the area around the displaced anchor, PHMSA has no objection to Enbridge restarting the east leg of Line 5.”
The west segment returned to operation in July.
The company shut down both legs of the pipeline in June after noticing a disturbance to an underwater anchor supporting the eastern line.
“The decision to allow the restart of the east segment of Line 5 is very positive for the many residents and businesses in Michigan and the Great Lakes region who depend on the energy Line 5 delivers,” said Vern Yu, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines.
“Enbridge will continue to focus on the safe operation of the dual Line 5 pipelines at the Straits of Mackinac, ensuring the Great Lakes are protected while also reliably delivering the energy and feedstock that helps to fuel Michigan’s and the region's economy.”
Enbridge said it has throughout this period kept the State of Michigan fully advised of the status of the west and east segment investigations and will continue to do so.

Enterprise Abandons Texas Pipeline Project As Oil Prices Remain Weak | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Enterprise Products Partners LP on Wednesday abandoned a major 450,000-bbl/d Permian crude pipeline project in Texas and agreed to give customers lower near-term commitments on other pipelines as oil prices remain stagnant.
The cancellation of the Midland to ECHO 4 pipeline is in line with other delayed energy projects, including export terminals and pipeline builds, hurt by lower demand after U.S. oil producers chopped output to cope with oil prices below $40/bbl.
Many analysts have also said that pipeline capacity already in the Permian basin is more than needed at current production levels. The pipeline, also known as M2E4, was planned to transport crude from Midland, Texas –– the heart of the Permian basin –– to the ECHO 4 terminal in Houston.
In April, Enterprise pushed back the expected completion of the M2E4 line by six months to the second half of 2021 and cut its 2020 budget by $1.1 billion.
Chief financial officer Randall Fowler had said the project was backed by long-term contracts and ""in our minds, not cancelable.""
Enterprise said the cancellation will reduce growth capital expenditures for 2020, 2021 and 2022 by about $800 million. The decision will also tack on a $45 million impairment charge to third-quarter earnings this year.
Enterprise now expects growth capital expenditures to be $2.8 billion this year, $1.6 billion next year and $900 million in 2022.
Enterprise rival MPLX LP in May dropped its pursuit of a Permian to Gulf Coast natural gas liquids pipeline, while Kinder Morgan Inc. said in March its proposed Permian Pass pipeline faced an uncertain future as no customers had been lined up for the project because of low prices.

Canadian Growth Helps The Bottom Line For Pipeline Specialist STATS | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
STATS Ltd. is confident its 2020 performance and activity levels will be broadly consistent with those of 2019, despite a pandemic and falling oil prices.
The company generated C$67.3 million in revenue and $9.6 million earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), according to its annual accounts as at Dec. 31, 2019.
“As COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic during the early part of 2020, this had an impact on our trading performance,” Leigh Howarth, chief executive officer, stated in a news release. “Not surprisingly, several significant contracts which had been a long time in the planning were postponed by our clients until later this year or 2021, but on the positive side there is a healthy programme of work ahead of us.”
In Canada, the U.K.-based pipeline technology firm further consolidated its market position through provision of isolation services to major regional pipeline operators and gas distribution suppliers. A significant portion of revenue was derived from product sales, with close to 100 fittings designed and manufactured in the year. In order to support this continued growth, STATS’s Edmonton team relocated to a larger facility early last year.
The company also supplied large-diameter BISEP isolation tools to a leading energy delivery company. Other recent key milestones in Canada included provision of isolation services in Ontario. 
Elsewhere, STATS increased its market presence in the U.S., where revenues grew by 176 per cent in 2019 when compared to the previous year, and there was also a strong demand for Type Approved mechanical pipe connectors in the U.K. oil and gas sector. A move to larger premises in the U.A.E. and the opening of a new operational site in Oman strengthened STATS’s presence in the Middle East.
While 2019 revenue fell about 10 per cent from 2018 results, management says the largest-ever contract completed by STATS, for a major Abu Dhabi client, significantly contributed to those 2018 results.
In terms of dealing with the pandemic internally, Howarth said the response of STATS staff globally to a changing environment has been outstanding. “The introduction of new working practices has allowed us to continue delivering our services and, encouragingly, secure new work.
“As a result, and notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting lower demand for oil and the subsequent drop in price, we are optimistic that activity levels in 2020 will be broadly consistent with those of 2019.”

NGTL North Corridor Expansion Recommended For Federal Approval | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is recommending to the federal cabinet that it approve NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.’s (NGTL) North Corridor expansion project to transport gas from the Peace River Project Area to growing intra-basin markets in the North of Bens Area.
In a 331-page decision released Thursday, the commission said that in its view the project is and will be required by the present and future public convenience and necessity. In recommending approval, the CER said it considered the public interest which it defined as “being inclusive of all Canadians and referring to a balance of economic, environmental and social interests that changes as society’s values and preferences evolve over time.” 
In its recommendation, the commission included 34 conditions related to, among others, construction activities, safety measures and standards, environmental monitoring, Red Earth and Chinchaga caribou habitat protection and matters related to Indigenous peoples.
Based on the environmental assessment for the project, the CER concluded with the implementation of NGTL’s environmental protection procedures and mitigation measures, as well as its recommended conditions, the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. In reaching this conclusion, it said it has required, through its recommended conditions, that effects or consequences be minimized, even if they are only anticipated or possible and not certain.
 “The commission is of the view that with the successful implementation of these conditions, the potential residual effects associated with the project would be mitigated,” the CER said in its decision.
In the commission’s view, the benefits of the project are considerable and would be realized throughout the life cycle of the project. They include increased training and employment opportunities for Indigenous peoples and potential contracts for Indigenous-owned businesses along with increased access to intra-basin markets for Canadian natural gas.
NGTL anticipated that project construction would generate GDP of over $529 million, with 80 per cent ($425 million) in Alberta. The project is expected to generate more than 4,600 full time equivalent person-years of employment across Canada during development and construction, with most (75 per cent) of employment in Alberta with 3,480 full-time equivalent person-years of employment.
The project, though, also carries risks, said the CER. Burdens associated with the project include potential negative effects on the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples and project workers and as well as imitations on access for traditional users within the project area during active construction and potential operations and maintenance activities. Other drawbacks to the project include potential impacts to unidentified traditional land and resource use (TLRU) and cultural sites and lasting cultural implications stemming from potential cumulative effects on TLRU, according to the commission. 
A total of 26 Indigenous peoples were identified as being potentially affected or having an interest in the project and participated in the hearing process. The commission found that after having assessed all of the evidence on the record, and taking into account NGTL’s engagement commitments, the honour of the Crown has been upheld and that there has been reasonable consultation and accommodation for the purpose of its recommendations.
The CER also determined that “any potential project impacts on the rights and interests of affected Indigenous peoples are not likely to be significant and can be effectively addressed through the implementation of the mitigation measures and commitments made by NGTL, and the conditions and accommodations recommended and imposed by the commission.”
The North Corridor expansion project, which has in-service date of April 2023, consists of approximately 81 kilometres of looped pipeline, in three different sections, and associated facilities in northwestern Alberta. The pipeline components of the project cross through the counties of Northern Lights, Northern Sunrise and Clear Hills and the Municipal District of District of Opportunity No. 17.
NGTL said the proposed project route was applied because it reasonably minimizes impacts on the environment, landowners and land users while providing the most efficient design for construction and operations. The proposed pipeline routes were selected to parallel existing ROWs, except where there were constraints from existing industrial dispositions, or constructability constraints, said the CER.
Approximately 95 per cent (76 kilometres) of the pipeline route parallels the existing NGTL right of way (ROW) or other existing linear disturbances (pipelines, roads and power lines).  The commission noted that in determining the proposed route NGTL took input from landowners, occupants, land users, Indigenous peoples and environmental studies into consideration. An estimated 181 hectares of new permanent right of way and an estimated 86 hectares of temporary workspace will be required for construction.
The in-service date for the project has been pushed back by a year to April 2023 from April 2022. Earlier this year, based on a capacity optimization open season, NGTL deferred the in-service dates of six new projects, including the North Corridor expansion project.

Inter Pipeline Restores Partial Service On The Western Portion Of Polaris System | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Inter Pipeline Ltd. has safely restored services to the JACOS/CNOOC Limited Hangingstone facility on the western portion of its Polaris pipeline system. The eastern portion of the Polaris pipeline system continues to be fully operational.
At the incident site, located on the western side of the Polaris system, clean-up efforts are progressing well.
“Inter Pipeline’s top priority is to ensure the safety of the public, its workers and protection of the environment. Wildlife monitoring also continues throughout the area,” the company noted in a statement.
Inter Pipeline continues to investigate the cause of the release and will provide an update on the timeline for restart when available.
Earlier this week, Imperial Oil Limited said it was dialing back output at its Kearl oilsands operation due to the ongoing outage on Inter Pipeline’s diluent pipeline related to a release that was detected on Aug. 29, 2020.

Calls Mount For Germany To Rethink Nord Stream 2 After Navalny Poisoning | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — A European response that involves the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is needed against Russia after the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent, some politicians and diplomats in Germany said on Thursday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said she expected Moscow to join efforts to clear up what happened and that Germany would consult its NATO allies about how to respond, raising the prospect of new Western sanctions on Russia.  
""There must be a European response,"" Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday, when asked whether work on the NordStream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany should stop.
""We must pursue hard politics, we must respond with the only language (Russian President Vladimir) Putin understands — that is gas sales,"" said Roettgen, a member of Merkel's ruling conservatives.
Navalny is lying in intensive care in a hospital in Berlin after his flight was arranged by activists. A German military laboratory produced ""unequivocal evidence"" that he had been poisoned with Novichok, the government said on Wednesday.
Moscow has denied involvement in the poisoning of Navalny, a longtime critic of Putin's rule, and the Russian foreign ministry said Germany's assertion was not backed by evidence.
Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference and a former ambassador to Washington, backed a joint response from the EU and NATO and said softer gestures, such as the expulsions of diplomats, may not suffice.
""If we want to send a clear message to Moscow with our partners, then economic relations must be on the agenda and that means the NordStream 2 project must not be left out,"" said Ischinger, adding that a full boycott would not be a good move.
""We can't put up a wall between the West and Russia, that would be a step too far, but there is a middle ground, something between diplomatic gestures and total boycott,"" said Ischinger.

Imperial Dialing Back Kearl Output As A Result Of Diluent Pipeline Outage | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Imperial Oil Limited is dialing back output at its Kearl oilsands operation due to an ongoing outage on Inter Pipeline Ltd.’s diluent pipeline related to a release that was detected on Aug. 29, 2020.
All production at the Kearl operation has ceased at this time, and the facilities remain ready to ramp up to full production rates once the diluent pipeline is back in service and diluent supply is restored.
“Imperial’s first priority continues to be the safety of our employees, contractors and the communities where we operate, and the shutdown will be conducted in a safe and controlled manner,” it said. “The company is pursuing a number of steps to try to mitigate the operational impacts.”

Diluent Pipeline Partly Closed Following Spill Near Fort McMurray | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) —  Inter Pipeline Ltd. says it has partially shut down its Polaris pipeline system following a leak detected on Crown recreational land just east of the Fort McMurray airport.
According to the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), initial reports indicated about 550 bbls of light oil were released with no reported impacts to waterbodies or wildlife.
The pipeline is used to move light petroleum such as condensate from Edmonton to the region where it is used by oilsands companies to dilute heavy bitumen so it will flow in a pipeline to market.
In a report, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. warned the shutdown, if prolonged, could potentially affect the supply of diluent for steam-driven oilsands projects owned by companies including Imperial Oil Limited, Husky Energy Inc., Cenovus Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Limited.
On its website, Inter Pipeline says its leak detection systems signalled an anomaly on Saturday morning and its Polaris and Corridor bitumen pipeline systems were shut down. The source was discovered to be Polaris on Monday and the Corridor pipeline was restarted.
The company is in contact with its customers but has not yet identified the cause of the leak, nor does it have an estimate of how long it will take to make repairs and get the line running again, said spokeswoman Breanne Oliver.
In 2019, the Polaris system transported an average of about 238,000 bbls/d of diluent, Inter says on its website. Oliver said she couldn't say how much diluent is still being delivered.

Enbridge Restores Offshore Pipelines After Hurricane Shutdown | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Two natural gas pipelines that connect offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico production platforms resumed operation on Tuesday, Enbridge Inc. said, after hurricane-related shutdowns last week.
Energy companies continued to restart offshore operations after completing damage assessments following Hurricane Laura, which tore through the Gulf of Mexico with up to 150 mile per hour (240 kmh) winds. 
The Garden Banks pipeline, a one bcf/d natural gas line that connects to the Auger, Baldpate, Enchilada, and Magnolia offshore production platforms, was halted as a precaution last week.
It had remained shut as a communications problem was discovered when workers moved to restart operations, the company said on Monday.
Enbridge on Tuesday also lifted force majeure on its Nautilus line after an onshore facility completed unplanned maintenance, a spokesman said.

Need For TSP Extension Challenged By NGTL | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) has urged the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to dismiss an application from the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) seeking an extension of its Temporary Service Protocol (TSP) beyond its Oct. 31, 2020 expiry date.
In a letter to the commission, NGTL argues that “the application does not provide sufficient information on relevant matters, such as the need for an extension or any consultations with, and the impacts on, NGTL and its customers.” The company also says that it and its stakeholders continue to explore alternative long-term solutions to further enhance access to natural gas storage.
EPAC, which represents more than 130 producers and eight bcf/d of natural gas production in Western Canada, has applied to have the TSP extended by one year to Oct. 31, 2021 or until the NGTL 2021 system expansion receives leave to open. It says the application was prompted by concern about a potential delay in the in-service date for the NGTL 2021 expansion which could result in system constraints to gas storage which in previous summers resulted in significant price volatility.
However, NGTL says the TSP was a temporary solution only for the 2019 and 2020 summer seasons (April through October) to help manage system constraints during planned outage/maintenance periods upstream of the Clearwater and Woodenhouse compressor stations.
“NGTL applied for TSP for a limited timeframe on the basis of unique circumstances and broad industry support that had been validated through industry discussions,” it says. “NGTL does not believe that the same broad support exists for an extension of TSP.”
The TSP provision does not refer to the in-service date of any facilities and the CER in its approval said it did not set a precedent for future system curtailments, says NGTL.
According to the company, access to storage through Interruptible Transportation – Storage (IT-S) on the system was limited when it applied for approval of the TSP provision.  In the summer of 2019, approximately 300 mmcf/d of gas was injected into storage via IT-S, the third lowest injection level since 2000.
At the time, NGTL expected that the addition of new facilities, including the 2021 expansion project would help relieve key bottlenecks and increase the deliverability of the system.
Since April 2019, approximately one bcf/d of capacity additions have been put into service and have created additional operational flexibility on the system, says NGTL. Between April 1, 2020 and Aug. 28, 2020, an average of nearly 1.3 bcf/d of gas was injected into storage via IT-S, the highest level of injection for that period frame since 2000. “This level of injection occurred without the use of TSP as there have been no TSP-Applicable Constraint occurrences during 2020 to date,” it says. NGTL does not expect any constraints to be triggered prior to the expiry of the TSP.  
NGTL says it has “fundamental concerns” with an extension of TSP as it deviates from the priority of service in the tariff, prioritizing not only access to storage over firm transportation service but Interruptible Transportation-Delivery service (IT-D) over Firm Transportation (FT) services. “As such, extending TSP would skew market signals and increase the risk of decontracting of firm delivery contracts on the NGTL System by providing a disincentive for customers to contract for the service they need to meet their requirements,” it says.
Possible solutions 
NGTL says that following commission guidance in approving the TSP, it and its stakeholders have continued consultations to explore alternative long-term solutions to further enhance access to storage.
 The consultations were initiated in February 2018 through the Access to Storage Task Force of the TTFP and in January 2020 NGTL established the Executive Advisory Committee (EAC) in which executives discussed key issues affecting the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin and the NGTL System, says the company. The EAC identified, developed and assessed potential solutions and after discussions concluded in June 2020, consultation continued through the task force and remains ongoing, according to NGTL.
The company says it identified transfers to storage for FT-Delivery and FT-Receipt services (FT Transfers to Storage) as an enhancement to existing practices on the NGTL System that can be implemented before the next summer injection season beginning April 2021. “This solution would provide access to storage even when there is no capacity available for interruptible services, including IT-S,” it says.
The service would allow firm contract holders to temporarily transfer their firm service from their contracted receipt point or Group 1/Group 2 delivery point to a storage point. FT Transfers to Storage can be implemented within the existing tariff transfer provisions.
Other solutions to enhance storage access discussed by NGTL with the EAC and the task force included a new firm storage service, new biddable priority interruptible services at a priority ahead of existing interruptible services but below that of firm services, and modification of the existing Short-Term Firm Transportation service to provide access to storage locations in addition to Group 1 delivery points.
While these solutions have longer implementation timelines, NGTL says it remains willing to continue exploring, through the collaborative process, these or other solutions that would enhance access to storage while respecting the priority of services on the NGTL System.

Storm Damages Continue To Hamper U.S. Gulf Of Mexico Energy Operations | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Catastrophic damage to power lines and communications outages on Monday weighed on U.S. Gulf Coast refineries' post-Hurricane Laura assessments and on offshore oil and gas production.
Energy companies continued to inspect and restart offshore operations while onshore repairs were hampered by power outages. In Lake Charles, Louisiana, near where the storm made landfall early Thursday, Citgo Petroleum and Phillips 66 said reviews to their refineries could take days and neither could estimate restarts.
Offshore oil production was down by 989,000 bbls/d or 53 per cent of the region's daily output. Natural gas was down by 41 per cent, or 1.12 bcf/d the U.S. Department of Interior reported on Monday.
Up to 84 per cent of oil and 60 per cent of gas output was shut last week as a precaution. Oil markets shrugged off their storm premiums as Laura passed through the heart of the U.S. oil industry but spared bigger refineries in Houston and Beaumont, Texas.  
Energy companies returned crews to 181 of the 310 evacuated platforms and drilling rigs, U.S. regulators said.
Power provider Entergy Corp. said seven transmission lines serving the Lake Charles region were ""catastrophically damaged"" describing the destruction as ""some of the most severe the company has experienced.”
Total SA was waiting for power to be restored at its 225,500 bbl/d Port Arthur, Texas, oil refinery, people familiar with plant operations said. The French oil major said it was taking measures to restart the refinery, which sits about 40 miles (64 km) west of where Laura made landfall.
Valero Energy Corp. and Motiva Enterprises LLC, which also operate refineries in Port Arthur, were restoring equipment on Monday, sources familiar with their operations said. Motiva plans to resume output at its 607,000 bbl/d plant early this week, the sources said. Neither company was available for comment.
Citgo said its 418,000 bbl/d refinery suffered ""no major structural damage to operating equipment"" and repairs could begin while electric power was being restored.
An offshore natural gas pipeline that serves four major U.S. Gulf of Mexico production platforms also remained out of commission, Enbridge Inc. said, following Laura's destructive path through the area.
Enbridge declared force majeure on the Garden Banks and Nautilus natural gas lines after inspecting facilities over the weekend. Nautilus resumed operations on Sunday, but declared force majeure for a second time on Monday, citing unplanned maintenance at an onshore gas processing plant.
The Garden Banks pipeline, a one bcf/d natural gas line that connects the Auger, Baldpate, Enchilada and Magnolia offshore production platforms to onshore lines, was shut due to a communications problem, the company said.
Late on Monday, Enbridge said it would restart operations once it was safe to do so. A spokesman did not say when the communications issue might be resolved.

U.S. Army Corps Asks Appeals Court To Reverse Dakota Access Pipeline Ruling | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) – The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday asked an appeals court to reverse a ruling which scrapped an environmental permit that allows the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline to operate on U.S. land.
Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) to detail options by the end of the month for resolving the loss of the permit.
On Wednesday, ACE and Dakota Access, controlled by Energy Transfer LP, argued that the district court abused its discretion in vacating the permit and ordering a thorough environmental study to be conducted.
They also argued the court's ruling sets impossible standards that would discourage major infrastructure investment, waste government resources and pose economic and environmental harm.
""The district court's decision will create a new, heightened standard of judicial review that will be impossible for agencies to meet as they consider vital infrastructure projects,"" ACE said in the brief.
The loss of the permit could force the 570,000 bbl/d pipeline, the biggest out of North Dakota’s Bakken shale region, to be shut and drained.
The pipeline, which runs under a critical drinking water source for the Sioux tribe in South Dakota, drew months-long protests by environmental activists and Native American tribes before coming into service in mid-2017.
Dakota Access has said it could lose billions of dollars if the line was idled for an extended period.

"More Consideration Of Aboriginal Rights Needed In Edson Mainline Expansion Approval, Says First Nation | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Stoney Nakoda Nations (SNN) have urged the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to require NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) or the Crown to conduct an assessment of potential impacts of the proposed Edson Mainline expansion on treaty and Aboriginal rights or to meaningfully include SNN’s evidence and concerns in the conditions of project approval.
The assessment should include potential impacts to SNN’s water rights within Iyarhe Nakoda Makochi, the nations’ traditional territory, as well as accommodation, with the participation of SNN, SNN says in final argument for the hearing into the proposed Edson expansion.
The project is comprised of approximately 85 kilometres of 48-inch pipeline loops in two sections. It would increase pipeline capacity to transport gas from the Peace River Project Area northwest of James River and west of the Meikle River compressor station to growing intra-basin markets in central and southern Alberta.
In its submission, SNN says that as the Crown relies on the commission process in fulfilling its duty to consult, it is essential to consider the evidence on the record that deals with potential adverse effects of the project on the nations’ constitutionally protected Section 35 rights. “There has not been an adequate assessment and consideration of potential impacts of the project on SNN’s Section 35 Rights, nor appropriate accommodations,” says Stoney Nakoda.
NGTL’s environmental and socio-economic assessment (ESA) reviewed potential project effects on the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes (TLRU) as a valued component (VC) but that is only one component of Section 35 rights and therefore is not a complete or comprehensive consideration of those rights, says SNN.
 “An ESA focusing solely on TLRU and other biophysical and environmental concerns, then, cannot be used as a proxy for a Section 35 rights impact assessment,” it says. “Section 35 rights, while they may overlap with other issues and factors such as environmental effects, must be reviewed and assessed separately.”
Any decision affecting treaty or Aboriginal rights made on the basis of inadequate consultation will not be in compliance with the duty to consult, says SNN.
According to Stoney Nakoda, NGTL claims that the methods it used with respect to its ESA are “reasonable, defensible, and valid” because they rely on current scientific understandings of project effects and its own past experience and it makes similar claims with respect to its TLRU assessment. “However, western scientific understandings and past operating experience cannot replicate or replace Indigenous traditional knowledge,” says SNN.
The Traditional Knowledge Report (TKR) included with the company’s ESA sets out the information that NGTL used for its TRLU assessment and SNN says it understood that the deficiencies in the NGTL reports could be addressed by Stoney Nakoda’s Section 35 rights assessments reports.
NGTL in its final argument, though, urged the commission to give little weight to the reports, suggesting that they are “unreliable and fundamentally flawed.” The reports identify potential project interactions or provide conclusions about project effects that differ from the conclusions in the ESA, according to the company.
However, SNN’s reports must be meaningfully considered as the mechanism to assess project impacts to Section 35 rights because they were the only ones that produced that information, says Stoney Nakoda. “Failing to do so would contribute to a breach of the duty to consult.”
NGTL said it relied on the NEB filing manual’s requirement of an assessment of potential project effects on TLRU as the mechanism to assess project impacts to Section 35 rights.
In response, SNN describes that requirement as “outdated” and not in line with guidance of the Supreme Court of Canada regarding assessments of impacts to Indigenous and Treaty rights and the Crown’s duty to consult. “Further, the evidence in SNN’s Section 35 reports resulted in no changes to NGTL’s project application, despite highlighting in many deficiencies of NGTL’s assessment and SNN’s many remaining concerns about potential project impacts,” says Stoney Nakoda.
One identified adverse effect of project approval, it says, would be a decrease in lands that are available to SNN for the exercise of their Section 35 rights by 259.34 hectares. “This occurs not just from the taking up of Crown lands for the project such that SNN’s access to the lands is restricted, but also from the disturbance of the lands so as to affect SNN’s use of the lands for the exercise of their Section 35 rights,” says SNN.
It is important to note, it says, there are already minimal lands available for the exercise of Section 35 rights in the area of the proposed project. “Loss of available lands affects not only the ability of SNN members to hunt, fish and gather, but also affects SNN’s family camps, cultural events, ceremonies and sacred sites and the transfer of knowledge to younger generations, all of which are integral to maintaining SNN identity and culture.”
SNN also submits that water rights are a critical component of its Section 35 rights, and thus the project should not be approved until such rights have been adequately considered and accommodated. “Notably, SNN has already felt the cumulative effects of development on its water rights, as SNN’s access to, and the cleanliness of, water within Iyarhe Nakoda Makochi has been diminishing over time,” it says.
NGTL has failed to adequately address its evidence with respect to its rights to water, which includes the substantive right to fish, within Iyarhe Nakoda Makochi, says SNN. Although the project would threaten sensitive bull trout habitat, SNN says NGTL did not take the nations’ evidence related to bull trout into consideration when selecting the project route. In addition, there have been insufficient studies in the project area to understand migratory patterns of culturally important fish species, according to Stoney Nakoda.

Lauerman: Biden Presidency Series Part 4 — Impact On Canadian Oil And Gas | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"

Joe Biden, the Democratic Party nominee for the U.S. presidency, upped the ante for his Clean Energy Revolution yet again on August 11, by selecting California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. Harris is a hardcore backer of the Green New Deal — and supporter of a fracking ban as well —  having sponsored a draft legislative proposal related to it with Democrat firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the first-term House Representative from New York State.
Part One of this four-part series explored Biden’s plan to combat global climate change, based on his Clean Energy Revolution and a scaled-back version of the Green New Deal, while Part Two identified his probable policies for the U.S. oil and gas industry upon becoming president. The third part quantified the potential impact of these policies on global energy consumption, energy mix and U.S. oil and gas production under two scenarios, Medium Emissions and Low Emissions.
The fourth and final part of this series explores the potential impact of Biden’s anti-Keystone XL (KXL) pipeline position on the Canadian oil industry. To do so, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers’ (CAPP) June 2019 long-term outlook for western Canadian oil supply — CAPP deferred release of its 2020 outlook on June 2 due to global uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic — is compared to new capacity presently coming online from other pipeline projects to determine the need for KXL in the future.
In addition, Part Four quantifies the potential impact of Biden’s climate change policies on the Canadian oil and gas industry under the Medium Emissions and Low Emissions scenarios through 2035, again using the Reference Case from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) International Energy Outlook 2019 — the global equivalent of CAPP’s June 2019 outlook for western Canadian oil — as the basis for comparison.
Keystone XL
On May 18, the Biden election campaign vowed in a statement to kill TC Energy Corporation’s KXL pipeline project if he is elected president. This should have come as no great surprise since Vice President Biden stood next to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office when he killed KXL with an executive order in November 2015 — with President Donald Trump subsequently resurrecting it from the dead in January 2017.
Cancelling KXL is almost all upside for Biden from a political perspective. If he is to defeat President Trump in November, he needs to energize the progressive base of the Democratic Party and get them out to vote — something Hillary Clinton failed to do in the 2016 presidential election, after her long drawn out battle with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the party’s nomination — and KXL is the ideal issue to do so.
Since TransCanada — as TC Energy was previously known — first proposed the KXL pipeline in July 2008, it has become a lightning rod for climate change campaigners in the U.S. The ‘tar sands’ is viewed as the “thin edge of the wedge” for producing oil from high-carbon sources by environmentalists — coal-to-oil being their greatest fear — and as the pipeline was to move 830,000 bbls/d of diluted bitumen from northern Alberta to refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, it simply had to be stopped.
At the same time, there is no reason to believe Biden will renege on his KXL campaign promise if he wins. He had a solid track record of supporting climate change initiatives in the U.S. Senate, has more than tripled proposed spending on his Clean Energy Revolution in recent weeks, and just added a New Green Dealer as his vice presidential running mate.
Impact on Canadian oil
On the bright side, Biden killing KXL should not lead to a new shortage of oil pipeline capacity from Western Canada for a decade or more, despite regional producers suffering from a shortage for much of the past decade.
The current COVID-induced pipeline surplus should dissipate over the next year or so, as global and North American oil consumption rebounds, but reappear by 2023 with a large slate of small and large-scale pipeline projects moving forward besides KXL. And that is assuming CAPP’s relatively optimistic June 2019 outlook for regional supply — projections for Canadian oil output under the Medium Emissions and Low Emissions scenarios, to be discussed below, are far more negative (see Table 1).

Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 Replacement and the Canadian government’s Trans Mountain expansion (TMX) projects should add almost one million bbls/d of pipeline capacity from Western Canada by December 2022 — 370,000 bbls/d and 590,000 bbls/d, respectively. In addition, there are several low-risk, small-scale projects to expand capacity, totaling another 440,000 bbls/d, scheduled to be online in a similar timeframe. In total, these projects should add 1.40 million bbls/d to regional oil pipeline capacity by the end of 2022.
Based on CAPP’s June 2019 supply outlook, and assuming 240,000 bbls/d of crude-by-rail is backed out — roughly the amount of western Canadian crude exported by rail in 2018 — there would be 520,000 bbls/d of surplus pipeline capacity in 2023. Even without KXL, a surplus would remain until 2030.
But capital spending by Canada’s oil and gas producers was $34 billion in 2019, almost a tenth less than originally forecast by CAPP, and a far cry from the record spend of $81 billion in 2014. On June 9, CAPP slashed its estimate for 2020 capital spending to $23 billion, compared a forecast of $37 billion in January, with the spending collapse suggesting Western Canada’s surplus of crude pipeline capacity could last long past 2030, with or without KXL.
Energy landscape
As discussed in Part Three of this series, the global energy market is very different through 2035 under the EIA Reference Case and the Medium and Low Emissions scenarios. Due to differing assumptions about global economic growth and improvements in energy intensity, average growth in global energy consumption ranges between 1.1 per cent per year for the EIA Reference and no growth under Low Emissions — with Medium Emissions roughly in the middle.
The shift in global energy mix is even more extreme over the projection period, with coal and oil especially hard hit under the Medium Emissions and Low Emissions scenarios, renewables the big winner, while natural gas maintains a relatively steady share of the market. In fact, coal consumption declines dramatically in both scenarios, oil consumption declines somewhat or more, and gas consumption increases either six per cent or one per cent (see Table 2).

In turn, relative weakness in global oil and gas consumption under Medium Emissions and Low Emissions weighs on prices for these two commodities through 2035. The EIA Reference Case assumes a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) equivalent price of around US$75/bbl in 2035, trending higher from US$65 in 2018. The Henry Hub (HH) price for natural gas is assumed to increase from US$3.15/mmBtu in 2018 to about US$3.50 in 2035.
In contrast, WTI is assumed to average US$50 over the projection period under Medium Emissions, and HH gas to average US$2.75. Average prices for the Low Emissions scenario are US$40/bbl and US$2.25/mmBtu, respectively.

These lower prices weigh heavily on Canadian oil and gas production, especially under the Low Emissions scenario, with oil production taking the brunt for two reasons. Relatively high costs for new production from Alberta’s oilsands compared to U.S. light-tight oil (LTO) — and many other sources of oil — and the potential for greater cost reductions for the latter than the former.
U.S. LTO resource is becoming increasingly dominated by deep-pocketed international oil companies (IOCs), allowing for greater research and development spending to cut costs, whereas Canada has seen an exodus of IOCs from the oilsands in recent years.

Canadian oil production declines 16 per cent to 4.4 million bbls/d between 2018 and 2035 under Low Emissions, a more modest three per cent for Medium Emissions, while increasing 17 per cent under the EIA Reference Case (see Table 3). The differences for Canadian gas production over the projection period are less extreme for the three scenarios, declining by six per cent to 5.3 tcf in 2035 under Low Emissions, compared to increases of two per cent and 14 per cent under Medium Emissions and the EIA business-as-usual case, respectively.

EPAC Seeking Extension To NGTL Temporary Service Protocol | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is seeking comments on an application from the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) seeking an extension of the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) tariff that gives shippers easier access to storage during periods of pipeline maintenance.
The group wants the Gas Transportation Temporary Service Protocol expiry to be extended by one year to Oct. 31, 2021 or until the NGTL 2021 system expansion receives leave to open, whichever occurs first.
The EPAC submission was in response to an announcement from the federal government that cabinet approval of the NGTL project would be delayed until no later than Oct. 19, 2020.
The expansion is designed to transport natural gas from the western side of the system to the growing demand on the east side. It would “loop” or add new pipeline parallel or adjacent to, the existing NGTL System. The project consists of approximately 344 kilometres of pipeline in eight pipeline section loops, three compressor station unit additions and a control valve.
NGTL had requested approval of the application by the second quarter of 2020 to enable project construction to be completed in time to achieve the commercially required in-service date of April 2021.
Under the preliminary timeline, pipeline construction was scheduled to begin in September 2020 to enable construction activities to occur primarily during the winter season to take advantage of frozen ground conditions for access to and along the pipeline right-of-ways. NGTL, though, has indicated that it may not be able to complete portions of the construction program prior to the 2021 summer gas season (April-October).
Any delay in the expansion project could result in the same disruptions that the Temporary Service Protocol was intended to remedy, according to EPAC.
As part of the commission comment process, NGTL is required to file by 4 p.m. MDT on Aug. 31, 2020 the current NGTL gas transportation tariff and any comments on the application. The filing is to include comments on whether NGTL and its customers have explored alternative long-term solutions to meet system needs as noted by the commission in its reasons for decision. 
Interested parties and shippers must file any comments with the commission and serve them on NGTL and EPAC by 4 p.m.  MDT on Sept. 15, 2020 and NGTL must file any reply comments with the CER, and serve them on its shippers, the NGTL TTFP, parties to the 2019 proceeding on the tariff, interested parties and EPAC by 4 p.m. MDT on Sept. 22, 2020
EPAC must file any reply comments with the commission  and serve them on NGTL and parties to the 2019 CER proceeding on the protocol by 4 p.m. MDT on Sept. 29, 2020.
After reviewing the comments, the commission may issue its decision on the matter or establish a further process to deal with the application.

"Clarity Needed In UNDRIP Legislation, Webinar Told | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
While the federal government has committed to introducing legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), it needs to be clear what that means, a recent webinar on Indigenous engagement with the resource industry was told.
The British Columbia government last year affirmed UNDRIP in its Bill 41 but the legislators didn’t put in the effort to explain the implications, Heather Exner-Pirot, research advisor to the Indigenous Resource Network, said in response to a question during the event sponsored by the Macdonald-Laurier think tank. “There’s lots of questions it raises and it doesn’t answer any of them.”
“I hope the federal government avoids that mistake of introducing legislation that makes it harder to decide, … that does not clarify Indigenous rights but just kind of introduces another wrench,” she said.
That problem was highlighted earlier this year when Wet’suwet’un hereditary chiefs, opposed to the Coastal GasLink Pipeline Limited project, blockaded the pipeline right-of-way and both sides said Bill 41 supported their position, the webinar heard. “So there was no clarity offered; in fact, I think it might have muddied the waters and made it worse.”
Exner-Pirot said she is disappointed in the public discussion about UNDRIP in which it is seen as so black and white. “One side says the Indigenous community should have a veto on everything and the other side says, it just means it can't have a veto on anything,” she said. “And we've really reduced what is an incredible document to that one sentence: ‘free, prior and informed consent.’”
The document, Exner-Pirot pointed out, also talks about economic rights but “we never discuss that.”
New Zealand has taken a different approach in which it is starting with an action plan instead of legislating a separate UN political declaration that was never meant to be law, she said.
Indigenous groups are not homogeneous and that creates challenges when it comes to linear projects such as pipelines that cross a number of territories, said JP Gladu, president of the Alberta to Alaska Pipeline. In the case of the Wet’suwet’un, “you have 21 First Nations that are supportive of a project,” he said. “If one community has some governance challenges between hereditary and elected, does that veto the prosperity of 20 other communities that want this project?”
In Gladu’s view, a veto “is a little bit of a cop out” because it’s too easy to walk away from the table. “The hard work has to get done,” he said. “And just like any relationship, you're going to have your ups and downs, but you got to get off your butt the next morning and get back to the table and figure out the relationship.”
 “It’s way too easy to say ‘I give up’ and this country can't have that,” he added. “When it gets into linear projects, we have just got to do the hard work,” he said. “We’ve got to build the relationships.”
The idea of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) is not a veto, said Stephen Buffalo, president and chief executive officer of the Indian Resource Council. Rather, it has opened the door for First Nations to have an opportunity to take advantage of the investment opportunities that might be in front of them, he said.  “We definitely need to change that narrative [that FPIC is a veto].”
While First Nations communities might not like a project, “it's coming in our traditional territory and we have an opportunity now to have a stronger say,” he said. “Once you're an investment owner, you have a way stronger say as to how the program goes, how the infrastructure may be and you'll have a say on how it’s regulated.”
Webinar chair, Ken Coates, Munk senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, said that in his experience over the past 40 years, “Canadians generally are very supportive of Indigenous rights until they get them and so they're very supportive of Indigenous rights in the abstract.”
For example, when the courts found there was a duty to consult, there were predictions that would discourage oil and gas and pipeline development because it empowered the First Nations too much, he said. That wasn’t the case, though, as demonstrated by the increased number of benefits agreements between energy companies and First Nations, webinar participants heard.
“So empowering Indigenous people does not stop the Canadian economy, it balances the equation and it actually gives Indigenous people the right to be at the table in a different sort of way,” said Coates.
“Done properly, UNDRIP can actually be a successful tool in righting the balance and sort of creating some sort of equity and an equality in the system. Done poorly — which essentially is virtue signaling by saying, ‘hey, we support Indigenous rights, let’s throw this out there and see what happens’ — you end up with something that makes things worse rather than better.”

CER Rejects NGTL Hearing Request On Westcoast Sunset Creek Meter Station | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has refused a NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) request that it hold a hearing into an application from Westcoast Energy Inc. for additional metering capability at its existing Sunset Creek compressor station (CS-16).
In a written decision, the commission said in its view there is no outstanding material issue or public interest consideration that requires additional hearing steps in order for it to be able to make a decision on the Silverstar project that will provide an additional outlet for natural gas on the T-North system. The application has been deemed complete and the CER will issue a ruling within a maximum of 210 days.
Westcoast is planning to install a series of meter runs that will be capable of measuring natural gas flows of up to about 1.2 bcf/d along with auxiliary facilities including discharge piping, station isolation and pressure control valves. The meter station is designed to have enough capacity to meet potential future demands while ensuring the facility is used and economically feasible, according to Westcoast.
Pending regulatory approval, Westcoast would begin construction in the second quarter of 2021 with an in-service target of December 2021.
In a letter opposing a hearing, PETRONAS Energy Canada Ltd. said the Silverstar project would represent an important part of the Westcoast T-North gas transmission system, enabling the flow of gas from the T-North system to the Coastal Gas Link (CGL) pipeline and onwards to the LNG Canada project. The company holds 510 mmcf/d of firm capacity on T-North.
NGTL in seeking the hearing acknowledged the relatively small scope of the applied-for facilities but argued they could have significant and long-term impacts on NGTL and its customers   as well as its ability to compete with Westcoast for future LNG market demand.
The commission, though, described this position as “hypothetical.” It said it “does not find it credible that a surplus incremental metering capacity of roughly 690 mmcf/d at Silverstar could inappropriately convey on Westcoast a meaningful competitive advantage when competing with NGTL for future LNG market demand, when considered in light of the broader and substantial inter-pipeline competition in northeast B.C.”
In letters of comment, NGTL had raised concerns about the potential impact of the facilities on its Groundbirch East receipt station. It noted that all its FT-R (firm transportation-receipt) contracts at Groundbirch East (the NGTL interconnection point with Westcoast at Sunset Creek) have the ability to non-renew or relocate to another receipt point by 2023.
However, the commission said Westcoast has indicated that its T-North system will have sufficient capacity to serve both the PETRONAS contract at Silverstar and the current contracts at NGTL’s Groundbirch East receipt station. PETRONAS holds 510 mmcf/d of service on T-North over the full path from N3 to Sunset for a term of 40 years beginning at about the fourth quarter of 2023.
In the commission’s view, “it is both apparent and reasonable that shippers will decide themselves which markets to serve off the T-North system.”  NGTL, it said, has the option of using its contracting practices and toll design to protect its interests at Groundbirch East in this competitive situation.
PETRONAS said its Stella pipeline will connect the T-North system and Silverstar facilities to Coastal Gas. The 36-inch pipeline with a capacity of up to 2.3 bcf/d bridges the three kilometre gap between the 1.2 bcf/d Silverstar meter and the 5.7 bcf/d CGL pipeline inlet meter station, it said.
The sizing of the meter is important because it provides PETRONAS and its LNGC partners with the ability to purchase and deliver natural gas from the T-North system, whether on a short term or long term basis, and ensure the high reliability factor of the LNG Canada project on which the LNG sales contracts and investment decision in that project is premised, said PETRONAS.  A 1.2 bcf/d meter also provides North Montney producers and other T-North shippers with the opportunity to sell gas into a new and significant demand market, it said.
The CER also noted that the Westcoast application involves facilities of a small scale and modest cost ($25 million) yet the time to process it has taken longer than expected because a third-party has questioned the need, the appropriate tolling methodology for the meter station and its impact on future pipeline competition.
“In interventions of this nature in future regulatory proceedings, the commission urges parties to consider whether their issues can be addressed partially or completely outside the regulatory process, and whether their intervention is adequately warranted and an appropriate use of the regulatory process and resources,” it said.

"Aboriginal Rights Considered In Edson Mainline Expansion, Says NGTL | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) has challenged concerns raised by intervenors in a Canada Energy Regulator (CER) public hearing on its proposed Edson Mainline expansion project in relation to its effect on their Aboriginal and Treaty rights — the primary issue raised by intervenors during the hearing.
In written evidence, the company noted that several Aboriginal group intervenors challenged the sufficiency of the application and its Environmental and Socio-economic assessment (ESA) on the grounds that NGTL did not conduct an analysis of project impacts on Section 35 rights separate from Traditional Land and Resource Use (TLRU).
“However, neither case law nor the NEB filing manual require proponents to conduct the type of analysis suggested by these intervenors,” it said. “NGTL’s assessment complied with all applicable legal requirements, and assessed potential impacts on Aboriginal groups based on the best information possible.” That included all information provided by Aboriginal groups about how they consider they might be affected by the project, said NGTL.
The project, which is comprised of approximately 85 kilometres of 48-inch pipeline loops in two sections, is needed to increase pipeline capacity to transport gas from the Peace River Project Area northwest of James River and west of the Meikle River compressor station to growing intra-basin markets in central and southern Alberta.
In its filing, NGTL said Stantec Inc. conducted the ESA in accordance with the NEB filing manual and accepted best practices for federally-regulated pipelines. The ESA considered potential effects of the project on Aboriginal and Treaty rights through an assessment of effects on TRLU, including indicators such as the availability of access to sites and resources as well as impacts to relevant biophysical components, it said. The assessment considered publicly available information about Aboriginal land and resource use in the project areas, as well as all information provided to NGTL through its Aboriginal engagement program.
According to the company, its assessment of project effects on TLRU, along with the information provided directly by intervenors in the proceeding about impacts on their rights and interests “provides more than sufficient information to allow the Commission to assess how the project will affect Aboriginal and Treaty rights.”
NGTL said it assessed potential effects of the project on TLRU in accordance with the filing manual and established environmental assessment practices. “The assessment considered that with the exception of localized areas during short periods of active construction, the ROW (rights-of-way) will remain available for TLRU throughout construction and operations,” it said.
In addition, the assessment considered NGTL’s comprehensive mitigation measures to reduce the potential adverse effects of the project on the environment and on the use of those lands and resources by Aboriginal groups, the company said. These mitigation measures include providing potentially affected Aboriginal groups with the project construction schedule and maps so that potential conflicts between project construction and TLRU can be reasonably avoided or minimized, said NGTL.
The ESA concluded that with implementation of the proposed mitigation measures, the residual effects of the project on TLRU “will not be significant,” said the company.  In support of that argument, it cited NGTL’s operating experience, as well as the evidence from the Aboriginal group intervenors during the hearing that they continue to undertake TLRU activities throughout the project area, including along other existing NGTL rights-of-ways.
NGTL pointed out that a number of Aboriginal group intervenors suggested during the proceeding that the project ROW would legally restrict members from accessing those lands during construction and operation. That view, it said, is inconsistent with NGTL’s evidence that it will not restrict access to the ROW unless there is active construction or maintenance occurring in the area and the proposed land use poses safety risks to the workers or the land users.
Legally, persons exercising hunting and fishing rights in Alberta under the terms of a Treaty and Article 12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement may access Crown lands where there is no “visible, incompatible use,” it said. “Pipeline ROWs are not a ‘visible, incompatible use’ with TLRU activities and, in fact, the record demonstrates that TLRU activities are often carried out along existing NGTL ROWs in the area,” said NGTL.
The company also argued that its Aboriginal engagement for the project has been “reasonable and appropriate” for the scope and nature of the project. It began engagement with potentially affected Aboriginal groups in July 2018 and since then it has worked closely with each potentially affected Aboriginal group to provide information about the project and make opportunities available for the group to provide information about potential issues and concerns, it said. That has involved Traditional Knowledge (TK) studies, discussion of mitigation measures and the development of mutually acceptable solutions and benefits.
NGTL said it also has committed to continuing its engagement with Aboriginal groups throughout the life of the project and incorporating any additional input that it receives outside of the regulatory process into the project plans, as appropriate.
Several Aboriginal groups said they had neither the time nor capacity to fully participate in the hearing, said NGTL. Although not legally required to provide capacity funding, the company said it has offered potentially affected Aboriginal groups capacity funding to cover their costs of engaging with NGTL on the project, including identifying any issues and concerns and discussing mitigation. It said it also negotiated the appropriate amount of capacity funding for each group on a case-by-case basis.
For 19 different Aboriginal groups, NGTL’s capacity funding included money for the group to conduct a community-led project-specific Traditional Knowledge study.
In its final argument, NGTL urged the CER to give little to no weight to the conclusions of consultants’ reports filed by intervenors, suggesting that the reports are “unreliable and fundamentally flawed.” The reports identify potential project interactions or provide conclusions about project effects that differ from the conclusions in the ESA, according to the company.
The proposed Edson Mainline expansion is in the public interest and should be approved, said NGTL. “The project is economically viable, and its route, facilities and construction methods have been carefully chosen,” it said, noting that the majority of the project facilities will be located adjacent to NGTL facilities and other disturbances.

Five-Year NGTL Settlement Receives CER Approval | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has approved as filed the 2020-2024 revenue requirement settlement along with final 2020 rates and abandonment surcharges for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) System.
In a letter decision, the commission found that the settlement would result in tolls that are just and reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory. While it does not set rates for the 2020-2024 term, the settlement addresses the basis for determining the revenue requirement during the period.
In its approval, the CER said it also gave weight to the 11 comment letters filed in support of the settlement. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) for example, said it “provides for an alignment of interests between NGTL and its shippers with creative incentives to achieve sustainable cost efficiencies and lower tolls.” CAPP also said it believes the settlement provides a sustainable model that produces tolls that are more stable and predictable.
The commission also noted that the timing of both the Tolls, Tariff, Facilities and Procedures (TTFP) vote and the commission’s comment process allowed parties to consider the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their positions on the settlement.
NGTL initiated discussions with shippers on May 14, 2019 and the company held more than 25 meetings to conduct negotiations related to the revenue requirement. It presented the settlement to the TTFP on April 14, 2020 and participants voted on April 23, 2020. The outcome of the TTFP vote was an “unopposed resolution” meaning that, without regard for abstentions, the majority of the members voted ""for"" the proposed resolution with no member indicating it would actively oppose the settlement before the regulator or propose an alternative.
 The settlement addresses all components of the NGTL System revenue requirement for the period Jan. 1, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2024, subject to a review process that could reduce the term.
Provisions of the settlement include:

A flow-through cost component and a fixed cost component in the annual revenue requirement;
A rate of return on equity of 10.1 per cent and a deemed equity component of 40 per cent;
Baseline tolls and associated +/- 10 per cent toll bands for each year, which are used for the purposes of the Settlement Review Process, the Depreciation Rate Adjustment and the Incentive Sharing Mechanism;
A Settlement Review Process which is triggered if the annualized full path rate exceeds the upper toll band;
A Depreciation Rate Adjustment, where depreciation rates will increase if the annualized full path rate for any given year is below the baseline toll, up to a maximum depreciation rate;
An Incentive Sharing Mechanism which provides a framework for sharing variances to the fixed cost component between shippers and NGTL;
Information and reporting to be provided to the Tolls, Tariff, Facilities and Procedures Committee (TTFP) and the CER; and
Deferral accounts to capture variances between actual and forecast revenues and costs each year.

In its application, NGTL said the settlement is the product of open negotiations among NGTL and its customers through the TTFP, and that it represents a negotiated package of compromises that balances the diverse interests and positions of all parties.
The CER said that while the settlement covers a long-term five-year period from 2020-2024 in the midst of significant uncertainty, it is satisfied that the agreement provides sufficient adaptability to adjust tolls as circumstances change. The settlement does not set the revenue requirements or tolls for the term, and allows changes in costs and billing determinants to be reflected in the annual tolls applications that NGTL will file with the CER for approval, the regulator noted.
Deferral accounts will capture variances, subject to the Incentive Sharing Mechanism, between actual and forecast revenues and costs in each year, to be included in the subsequent year’s revenue requirement.
In concluding that the settlement provides sufficient adaptability, the CER said the Settlement Review Process provides a trigger to review and potentially terminate the settlement in the event tolls significantly increase. As well, NGTL’s tolls are regulated on a cost-of-service basis, such that the costs that NGTL may seek to recover during the settlement’s term must be prudently incurred, among other things, it said.
The CER also approved as final the interim tolls for the period Jan. 1, 2020-May 31, 2020 and the revised interim tolls it had earlier approved for the period June 1, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2020 along with the abandonment surcharges it had approved for the period Jan. 1, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2020.

Westcoast Receives CER Approval For Final Tolls For Zones 3 And 4 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has approved as filed final 2020 tolls for transportation service on Zones 3 and 4 of the Westcoast Energy Inc. system.
The regulator determined that the applied-for tolls were just and reasonable, and not unjustly discriminatory.
The commission earlier approved a negotiated settlement establishing a methodology for setting the tolls for transportation services in Zones 3 and 4 of the Westcoast system for 2020 and 2021.
Westcoast, doing business as Spectra Energy Transmission, copied settlement stakeholders, all shippers on the Westcoast system and its Toll and Tariff Task Force participants (TTTF) on the application and there were no comments, the CER noted.
In its application for final tolls, Westcoast asked that the tolls to be charged for the period Jan. 1, 2020-March 31, 2020 be equal to the interim tolls for transmission services earlier approved on an interim basis for the period.
It also requested that the final tolls to be charged for the period April 1, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2020 be equal to the revised interim tolls for transmission services in Zones 3 and 4 in effect effective April 1, 2020.

Tidewater Bullish On Prince George Refinery Prospects | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Demand for diesel and gasoline from the Prince George Refinery has increased dramatically in the last 60 days and demand currently is outpacing production, Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd.’s chief executive said Thursday.
Following several debottlenecking projects, the refinery is achieving record throughput of more than 12,000 bbls/d, Joel MacLeod, who also is president and board chair, said in a conference call to discuss second quarter 2020 results. Combined gasoline (42 per cent) and diesel (43 per cent) production is more than 10,500 bbls/day. 
Tidewater is well positioned to take advantage of anticipated government stimulus and infrastructure development in the Prince George area over the next 12 to 24 months, he suggested. The Coastal GasLink project in the area is ramping up and there has been significant activity in the B.C. Montney to the east, said MacLeod.
Recent announcements that one California refinery is closing later this year and another is converting to “renewable diesel” also are positive for the Prince George Refinery as diesel and gasoline production on the West Coast will be significantly reduced and it has the advantage of a Canadian crude supply.
In the second quarter, Tidewater entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) with respect to the sale of its 50 per cent interest in the Pioneer Pipeline LP for gross proceeds of $255 million. Tidewater said it expects to close the transaction by year-end 2020 although delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could delay the expected closing date into 2021, said MacLeod.
In addition, upon closing of the Pioneer transaction, TransAlta Corporation will pay Tidewater $10.5 million for certain ancillary assets not included in the transaction and for completion of budgeted restoration work, resulting in approximately $138 million in total cash consideration net to Tidewater. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year although delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could affect the expected closing date.
Financials 
Adjusted EBITDA for Tidewater nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2020 to a record $41.87 million from $21.79 million the previous year reflecting the acquisition of the Prince George Refinery and the commissioning of the Pipestone gas plant in 2019.
Tidewater is forecasting a strong second half of the year with $175 million to $185 million of adjusted EBITDA, said MacLeod. “Our number one priority remains deleveraging and free cash flow generation and we are confident in our ability to achieve our target of three to 3.5 times [net] debt to [adjusted] EBITDA with the closing of the Pioneer [Pipeline] sale.”
The net loss attributable to shareholders was $311,000 for the second quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $4.09 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Distributable cash flow was $10.56 million with a payout ratio of 32 per cent compared to $11.3 million and a payout ratio of 29 per cent in the comparable 2019 period.
To date, Tidewater has not committed to a significant capital program in 2020, however continues to evaluate smaller capital projects with the potential to generate returns in excess of 50 per cent.
Pipestone Gas Plant
The Pipestone gas plant had its strongest run to date in the second quarter of 2020, processing an average volume of 72 mmcf/d in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 10 per cent over the first quarter. Liquids production also increased by 65 per cent with the commissioning of the Pembina C2+ pipeline and the deep cut processing unit. Facility uptime and availability for the quarter averaged 96 per cent and 92 per cent respectively. The Pipestone plant is fully contracted with over 80 percent committed on take or pay arrangements.
On the marketing side, Tidewater is able to deliver a small ethane premium at Pipestone which is significant, said MacLeod. The tie-in of propane and butane gives it another lever to help optimize improved customer netbacks and leverage some of its relationships and rail cars to find new markets, he said.
Brazeau River Complex and fractionation facility
Throughput at the BRC for the second quarter of 2020 was in-line with the previous quarter. Tidewater is working diligently with producers to improve netbacks by fully utilizing the BRC's facilities, including its two NGL pipeline connections, condensate pipeline connection, truck loading and offloading facilities, fractionation, natural gas storage facilities and two natural gas sales pipeline connections.
The Brazeau River fractionation facility performed well through the second quarter of 2020 despite a challenging pricing environment and has maintained near capacity throughput since the start of the NGL contract year with several investment grade counterparties.  The marketing business found new ways to enhance producer netbacks and create operational flexibility by utilizing Tidewater facilities and maintaining disciplined risk management processes to mitigate frac spread and commodity exposure.
Natural gas storage
Tidewater operates natural gas storage reservoirs at three different facilities: Dimsdale Paddy A (Pipestone gas storage facility), Brazeau Nisku F, and Brazeau Nisku A. The Pipestone gas storage facility and Brazeau Nisku A are owned through joint ventures with a private Canadian entity and are accounted for as equity investments.
The Pipestone gas storage facility performed well in the quarter as it entered its first injection season following the 2019 expansion.  The facility successfully met customer park-and-loan commitments while pressuring up with a rapid inventory build in anticipation of next winter's expanded withdrawal obligations. The facility complex demonstrated its inherent optionality in the period by delivering gas to both Alliance Pipeline at the Saskatoon Mountain meter station and to TC Energy Corporation’s NGTL at Pipestone Creek.   
Similarly, both Brazeau Nisku A and Brazeau Nisku F storage pools have also been building inventories through the first part of the injection season while continuing to meet the Pioneer Pipeline delivery obligations as well as realizing liquids value benefit through cycling. Tidewater gas storage is mostly fully contracted for this winter, said MacLeod.
Prince George Refinery
During the second quarter of 2020, the Prince George refinery achieved over 85 per cent utilization, down by approximately five per cent from the first quarter of 2020 due to the planned two-week maintenance program at the refinery during April 2020. During the first half of the second quarter, as a result of the developing COVID-19 pandemic, refined product demand decreased and realized margins on refined product sales contracted due to declining commodity prices and a higher weighted average cost of inventory carried over from the first quarter of 2020.  However, this is partially offset by a portion of the realized gain on derivative contracts.
Tidewater achieved improved margins due to a recovery in refined product pricing and a lower weighted average cost of inventory from less expensive crude feedstock purchased during the first half of the quarter, while throughput remained consistent.
Tidewater said it is encouraged by the resilience of the asset in an unprecedented time with crack spreads holding steady at approximately $50/bbl. The company also continues to evaluate opportunities to participate in future low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) agreements at the refinery.
Director appointment 
Gail Yester has been appointed to Tidewater’s board of directors and will add significant legal, land, acquisition and divestiture experience to the board, said the company. Michael Salamon and Neil McCarron, both of Birch Hill Equity Partners Management Inc. also have joined the board.

North Suffield Pipeline Tolls To Be Subject Of CER Hearing | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) will hold a public hearing to consider an application from Campus Energy Partners Operations Inc. for proposed tolls and terms and conditions of service for the North Suffield Pipeline effective July 1, 2019.
The proceeding will consider the determination of the appropriate methodology for establishing just and reasonable tolls on the North Suffield Pipeline, including whether the tolls should be market-based or based on another methodology (such as cost of service) and whether Campus should have discretion to revise the interruptible service toll.
Campus acquired the North and South Suffield pipelines from AltaGas Ltd. in 2018 and filed revised tolls for the pipelines in 2019. However, Rockpoint Gas Storage Canada Ltd., Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. and Torxen Energy Ltd. objected to proposed higher tolls for North Suffield pipeline service and in a June 2019 decision, the National Energy Board, predecessor to the CER, ordered that that the tolls be made interim. Although the deferral of the new rates was intended to provide the parties with an opportunity to reach negotiated resolutions to the matters in dispute, the effort was unsuccessful.
In April 2020, as directed by the CER, Campus filed an application for tolls and conditions of service for the North and South Suffield pipelines. Following a motion by the complainants, the CER directed Campus to refile its application with additional information with respect only to North Suffield.
The total cost-of-service toll for Suffield North is 45.2 cents/gigajoule in 2019 and 45.2 cents/gigajoule in 2020. The figure is comprised of a unit cost-of-service toll of 36.3 cents/gigajoule in 2019 and 35.1 cents/gigajoule in 2020 plus an abandonment surcharge of 8.9 cents/gigajoule for both years.  In 2018, North Suffield tolls were 33 cents/gigajoule, including 24.1 cents/gigajoule for unit cost-of-service and 8.9 cents/gigajoule for an abandonment surcharge.
In the hearing, the CER will consider the appropriateness of proposed terms and conditions of service for the pipeline, including changed terms and conditions about which the complainants have raised concerns such as the treatment of abandonment costs and collection method, the introduction of an Interruptible Preferred Service and pricing mechanisms related to customer gas account balances.
In its letter to the parties, the commission said it would like the opportunity to ask parties questions and has included an oral component that will be conducted via teleconference or videoconference. Summary oral argument and reply has been set for Dec. 2, 2020.
While Rockpoint, Pine Cliff, and Torxen have been given intervenor status, any other shippers on Suffield North will also automatically be granted intervenor status if they file a letter of request by Aug. 26, 2020, said the commission.
In its application, Campus asks the CER to confirm that the Suffield Pipeline System operates as a commercially-at-risk pipeline charging market-based tolls.
It wants the regulator to direct shippers who received new firm or interruptible service on Suffield North since July 1, 2019 to pay to Campus the difference between the interim tolls and the tolls payable under the revised tolls and tariff for the interim period. The company also wants the CER to grant Campus the discretion to post a revised IT toll from time to time based on its assessment of prevailing market conditions, in an amount equal to or less than the IT toll proposed in the revised toll and tariff.
In addition, Campus wants the CER to dismiss the complaints of Rockpoint, Pine Cliff, and Torxen.

Foothills Pipe Lines Proposes West Path Delivery Project In B.C. | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has set a time limit of 300 days for a decision on the $133 million Foothills Zone 8 West Path Delivery 2022 project proposed by Foothills Pipe Lines (South B.C.) Ltd.
The CER has established service standards that state that 80 per cent of all decisions will be released by a target date. The service standard for a Category C application is 120 calendar days calculated from the date of a letter to the applicant.
The project consists of the British Columbia Mainline Loop No. 2 Yahk section, an approximately 13 kilometre 48-inch outside diameter natural gas pipeline and in-line inspection (ILI) launcher and receiver facilities. The project will be located approximately 25 kilometres east of Creston, British Columbia.
The proposed project route will cross Crown (79 per cent) and freehold (21 per cent) land and will parallel existing disturbances for approximately 70 per cent of the pipeline route. The proposed route starts at b-53-H/82-F-1 and will end at b-72-B/82-F-1 at the existing connection of the British Columbia Mainline and the Foothills South B.C. Pipeline with the East Kootenay Lateral.
The anticipated construction date is Feb. 15, 2022 with a requested in-service date for the facility of Nov. 1, 2022.
The project is required to increase the Foothills system capacity to meet incremental contractual obligations. It is underpinned by approximately 108 terajoules/d of incremental Firm Transportation – Delivery (FT-D) service on the Foothills South B.C.  system from the Alberta-B.C. Border to the Kingsgate border meter station.
The project will require the acquisition of approximately 47.5 hectares of permanent land.

Enbridge CEO Defends Line 5 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enbridge Inc. is continuing to work on its application for its Line 5 state-of-the-art tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac where the state of Michigan, citing safety concerns, is attempting to revoke the 1953 easement, closing the dual pipelines.
“We’re looking forward to the hearing as that'll help us get the facts out onto the table for everyone,” Al Monaco, Enbridge president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call to discuss 2020 financial results.
The 540,000 bbl/d pipeline transports crude oil and other products from Superior, Wisconsin to Sarnia via dual pipelines under the Straits.
“We're more committed to protecting the Great Lakes than anybody,” he said. “We've proven that by taking numerous additional actions and listening to the state's concerns very carefully to make a safe pipeline even safer.”
The crossing is continuously monitored by trained staff and state-of-the-art technologies and this is backed up with visual surveillance, said the company.
“We then committed to build a tunnel under the Straits to house a brand new line that will reduce the risk to near zero and that tunnel was blessed by the state government,” said Monaco.
The company has received initial environmental permits and is working on the remaining two approvals. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy on Jan. 29, 2021 issued permits relating to wetlands and submerged lands, along with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, said Enbridge. It continues to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Public Service Commission on additional permits and regulatory approvals.
“The fact is that the Straits segment is safe and PHMSA [Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration] has confirmed that more than once,” said Monaco.
“Secondly, the line is absolutely critical to Michigan and the entire surrounding region,” he said. “In our view, attempting to cancel the easement contradicts the U.S. federal jurisdiction over safety of the line and would severely hinder both interstate commerce and North American energy flows.”
Most importantly, “it endangers the energy security of millions of people and industry in the entire region, resulting in higher consumer costs and lost jobs at the worst possible time,” he said. And as Line 5 transports existing volumes, “shutting down this line is a very serious issue for everybody.”
According to Enbridge, Line 5 is a critical source of energy for residents, businesses and refineries throughout Michigan, its neighbouring U.S. states, Ontario and Quebec. It provides 55 per cent of the state of Michigan's propane demand and serves regional refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec. Residents, businesses and refineries throughout the region rely on the safe transportation of oil, propane and other products provided by Line 5, said the company.
In the fourth quarter, Enbridge initiated legal filings to request the United States District Court dismiss Michigan’s attempt to terminate the easement. It argues that the revocation of the easement is contrary to federal law and the Canada-U.S. Transit Pipeline Treaty. In addition, oversight of pipeline safety resides PHMSA under the federal Pipeline Safety Act.
The dual lines that cross the Straits are safe and in full compliance with the federal pipeline safety standards that govern them and has been deemed fit for service by PHMSA in June and September of 2020, according to the company.

Gulf Coast Refinery Demand For Heavy Oil Drives Volume Recovery On Enbridge Mainline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Throughput on Enbridge Inc.’s Canadian Mainline averaged 2.65 million bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2020, down from 2.73 million bbls/d in the 2019 quarter as volumes began to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The throughput was driven by a good WCSB response and strong pull from its heavy refinery customers in the United States where utilization was up nicely, Al Monaco, president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call today to discuss 2020 fourth quarter and full year results. “And it really shows the competitiveness of our system to the key markets.”
Heavy capacity has been apportioned since July on strong Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast market demand and light volumes are returning to normal.
Although volumes were down 400,000-bbls/ day in the second quarter of 2020, the company mitigated a good part of that with cost reductions and a number of productivity enhancements, he said. In July, Enbridge was able to use up some available light capacity by optimizing the system to move mediums.
“What really shines through was the strength of the basin and our system,” said Monaco. “That has a lot to do with how critical our heavy feedstock is to our U.S. customers. And given we expect to see further decline in global heavy supply, heavies off of our full path through to the U.S. Gulf will be in big demand.”
The Mainline moved an average of 2.62 million bbls/d in 2020 compared to 2.71 million bbls/d in 2019. “But we remain bullish on the longer term there in particular,” he said. “Part of that is economic growth in Asia, which continues to invest heavily to kick-start their local economies.”
This also lines up with Enbridge’s U.S. Gulf Coast strategy where it is starting to see renewed customer interest to support export infrastructure, said Monaco. “Global inventories are trending down, and with current discipline coming out of OPEC and U.S. shale production, we're seeing price stability.”
Financial results
In terms of financial results, “in what has been the worst economic and energy downturn in decades, we grew cash flow and increased the dividend when others went the other way and we ended the year with an even stronger balance sheet,” he said.
Full year 2020 GAPP earnings, including non-recurring and unrealized items, were $2.98 billion ($1.48 per common share) compared to $5.32 billion ($2.64 per common share) in 2019. Adjusted earnings before interest, income tax and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $13.27 billion, flat with $13.27 billion the previous year.
Cash provided by operating activities was $9.78 billion (2019-$9.4 billion) while distributable cash flow was $9.44 billion compared with $9.22 billion in 2019.  
Fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $1.78 billion (88 cents per common share) compared to $746 million (37 cents per share) in 2019 while adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion (2019-$3.19 billion).
Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $2.25 billion (2019-$1.99 billion) and distributable cash flow was $2.21 billion compared with $2.05 billion in 2019. 
Enbridge increased the 2021 quarterly dividend by three per cent to 83.5 cents/share.
During the year, Enbridge progressed $16 billion of secured growth capital and placed $1.6 billion of growth projects into service in 2020 and early 2021. It also began construction on the final leg of the Line 3 replacement project in Minnesota following receipt of all permits and regulatory approvals with a fourth quarter 2021 in-service target.
The company anticipates placing approximately $10 billion of its secured growth capital into service in 2021, including the U.S segment of Line 3 and the associated Southern Access expansion. On the natural gas side, projects to into go service include the T-South expansion and Spruce Ridge projects in British Columbia.
In Gas Transmission, Enbridge completed its U.S. $700 million 2020 modernization program, $100 million Sabal Trail Phase II and the final phase of $100 million Atlantic Bridge project. The company also came to an agreement with its customers for new rates on Texas Eastern, Algonquin and the B.C. Pipeline and is advancing rate proceedings on a few other systems.

Trudeau’s Trade Chief Spurns Nafta Challenge On Keystone XL | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is rejecting calls for a more combative response to U.S. protectionism, hoping a conciliatory approach will mend relations damaged during Donald Trump’s presidency.
Trade Minister Mary Ng said in an interview this week she is focusing her efforts with the new Biden administration on mutual U.S.-Canada interests despite early policy hiccups that risk further fracturing ties between the two nations, whose commercial relationship is worth $725 billion a year.
The rocky start began when President Joe Biden cancelled permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, a move that prompted the leader of Alberta to threaten a challenge under the old North American free-trade pact. Tensions grew when the new administration strengthened “Buy American” provisions for government procurement contracts.
“I don’t think that getting into a trade war with the U.S. is in the best interests of Canadian workers or the energy sector,” Ng said Wednesday. “What we’ve got to do is find that common ground where Canadian interests are viewed and seen as American interests as well.”
The trade minister’s comments highlight Trudeau’s decision to sidestep flashpoints with Biden and instead channel energy into goals such as fighting climate change and fostering an economic recovery.
Integrated economies
Trudeau’s officials welcomed Biden’s arrival at the White House after the Trump era, which upended years of relative stability with Canada’s largest trading partner.
The two countries exchanged almost $2 billion in good and services every day in 2019. Their economies are so integrated that the average automobile manufactured in North America crosses the U.S.-Canada border seven times before being sold, Ng said.
Biden’s “Buy American” rules are intended to boost the U.S. economy by pushing federal agencies to source goods and services from domestic businesses. The government spends nearly $600 billion annually on such contracts.
 “Canadian contributions –– our business contributions, our exporter contributions ––  into those supply chains and value chains are absolutely important to American workers and American businesses,” Ng said when pressed on how the government will push back against the president’s plan.
A key part of Trudeau’s strategy is to convince the president that protectionism will hurt U.S. businesses that rely on Canadian products.
“It’s the outcome that’s the important thing here,” Ng said. “The outcome is that Canadian businesses and Canadian workers aren’t impacted and that we continue to have access to that market, that our supply chains don’t get disrupted.”
The two countries are also divided on how to power North America’s green-energy transition. Trudeau tried unsuccessfully to convince the new administration that Canadian crude is a cleaner option due to his government’s carbon tax and stringent environmental regulations.
TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL would ship more than 800,000 bbls/d of cruse from the oilsands to U.S. refineries. Premier Jason Kenney, who poured C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) of taxpayer money into the project, called on Trudeau to impose trade sanctions in response to Biden’s decision.
Biden’s move, however, is part of a bigger reshaping of perceptions in Washington around the energy relationship with Canada. For decades, energy security was seen as a continental affair, with Canadian oil producers enjoying market access while the U.S. gained security of supply.
Canada has shipped C$838 billion worth of oil and gas to the U.S. over the past decade, representing 16 per cent of total exports to all countries.
Trudeau’s government is toying with new trade strategies that focus less on selling commodities and more on tapping the global market for other goods, particularly consumer related. The opportunities afforded by electronic commerce –– particularly for smaller businesses –– is one area that officials like to highlight.
It’s an emphasis for Trudeau that was made explicit in 2019 when the prime minister –– upon naming Ng to the job –– rebranded the cabinet post as Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade.
The focus on “small” isn’t lost on Ng, an immigrant from Hong Kong who moved to Toronto with her parents at age seven. In the interview, she highlighted how she spent her childhood working in her parents’ restaurant and keeps a picture of its menu in her office.
Nor has the pandemic slowed her efforts to promote the nation’s exporters: Ng has made virtual trade missions central to her work. “I’m not going to let COVID-19 stop me from helping businesses do business,” she said.
But there’s no denying COVID has hit the nation’s trade sector hard. Exports fell by 12 per cent in 2020, Ng’s first year on the job, one of the biggest annual drops in the past century.
The other potential remedy for Canada’s export troubles is China, but relations with the Asian giant soured sharply after the 2018 arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive on a U.S. extradition request. China subsequently locked up two Canadians and halted billions in agricultural imports.
“I don’t believe the conditions are there right now for trade discussions,” Ng said when asked about China. “The government’s priority is on working on securing the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.”

Brookfield Infrastructure Makes Offer To Acquire Inter Pipeline In Transaction Valued At C$13.5 Billion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. made an unsolicited C$7.08 billion ($5.6 billion) offer on Wednesday to buy Inter Pipeline Ltd. as it seeks to benefit from rebounding oil and gas demand, after an approach last year was rebuffed.
Brookfield, which owns and operates assets in the utilities, transport and storage sectors, said it has acquired 19.65 per cent economic interest in Inter Pipeline, to become the top shareholder in the Calgary-based company.
The infrastructure firm offered C$16.50 per share for Inter Pipeline, a 23.13 per cent premium Wednesday's close, valuing the company's equity at C$7.08 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at about C$13.5 billion.
Brookfield said it is willing to sweeten its offer to between C$17 and $18.25 a share if it is granted access to due diligence.
Brookfield said it started amassing Inter Pipeline shares in March 2020 and first approached the company to discuss a deal in September, but discussions stalled as the two companies had markedly different views of Inter Pipeline's value.
Rebounding demand
Pipeline space for crude was in high demand in Western Canada before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and caused both oil demand and supply to fall sharply. The region's production has rebounded quickly this year.
""Despite a strong recovery in global equity markets and a return of commodity prices to pre-COVID levels, IPL’s share performance and credit profile continues to be strained,"" Brookfield said in a statement detailing its offer.
Inter Pipeline did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares in the company nearly halved through 2020 but have ticked up about 13 per cent since the start of this year.
Pipeline companies are attractive to pension funds and private equity firms alike as they generate steady cash flow through long-term contracts, helping limit volatility in crude oil prices tumble. Such steady yielding assets are especially in demand during near zero interest rate environment.
The offer is fully financed, with a maximum cash consideration of about C$4.9 billion and a maximum aggregate number of BIPC shares issued of about 19 million, Brookfield said.
In 2019, Inter Pipeline rejected an unsolicited C$12.4 billion buyout offer from an unnamed bidder, with media reports later revealing the suitor as Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. That offer valued Inter Pipeline shares at around C$30 each.
Brookfield Infrastructure has engaged BMO Capital Markets and Barclays Capital Canada Inc. to act as joint financial advisers.
In a statement, Inter Pipeline confirmed that it previously received unsolicited, non-binding and conditional proposals from Brookfield in the range of $17 to $18.25 per share.
“Upon receipt of the conditional proposals, consistent with its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of all shareholders, the company's board of directors engaged legal and financial advisors to assist the company in assessing the conditional proposals,” said Inter Pipeline.
In response, based on a comprehensive assessment of the conditional proposals, the board informed Brookfield that they did not reflect the intrinsic value of the company and “were not sufficiently pre-emptive to grant Brookfield exclusivity.”
“The board reminds shareholders that no formal offer has been made by Brookfield, and as such there is no need for shareholders to take any action at this time. When a formal offer is made, it will be reviewed by the board with its legal and financial advisors, and a formal recommendation by the board will be made to shareholders in due course,” said the company.
Inter Pipeline has engaged TD Securities as its financial advisor and Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP and Dentons Canada LLP are acting as legal advisors to Inter Pipeline and its board of directors. Kingsdale Advisors is engaged as strategic shareholder and communications advisor to the company.

Energy Transition Discourse Often Does Not Account For Real Impact Of Oil And Gas Jobs: Eyre | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Saskatchewan Minister of Energy and Resources Bronwyn Eyre says she has seen first-hand the benefits that the oil and gas industry brings to communities in her province.
Given this, she cautions certain elected officials on simply “tossing out ideas” about energy transitions without considering the impacts on oilfield workers and their families.
“It’s simply dismissive and glib to say they can all transition magically to green jobs in the renewable sector,” she told a Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC) virtual town hall webinar on Tuesday. “That is, of course, easier said than done.”
One example highlighted during Eyre’s talk happened in her own provincial capital. At Regina’s Jan. 27 regular council meeting, council withdrew a motion that, if passed, would have restricted companies or organizations involved in the sale or production of fossil fuels from pursuing sponsorships, naming rights and advertising with the City of Regina. Coun. Dan LeBlanc brought forward the initial motion at the city’s Jan. 20 executive committee meeting.
“We have seen a lot of upheaval in the last few [years] in the oil and gas sector. We have seen a huge amount of impact on people from decisions federal and otherwise,” Eyre said. She added: “People need to think twice when they make statements around transition. They need to think twice about what’s actually the impact.”
Eyre noted that if every oil and gas-producing country extracted their hydrocarbons in the same way Canada’s energy sector does, then global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would fall instantly by 25 per cent. “It’s truly astounding how clean, how green, how innovative we are, and how responsible we are.”
Last year, noted the energy minister, Saskatchewan launched its Accelerated Site Closure Program (ASCP) with federal funds that were provided for well abandonment and reclamation work in Western Canada. She said that her province’s abandonment program currently is a stimulus measure.
“Obviously, this is a major, major infrastructure program, with major dollar figures, and we’re kind of within that ‘mobilization mode’ now,” Eyre told the CAODC virtual town hall. “But we certainly saw this as something we hope will put things in place for beyond the program in terms of just the supply side, developing the supply side, expanding it, diversifying it, and that kind of thing.”
Province announces new ASCP Indigenous participation program
On Tuesday, the Saskatchewan government introduced the First Nations Stewardship Fund and the Indigenous Business Credit Pool, which are two initiatives that support First Nations and Métis participation in the ASCP.
“That was required, of course, as part of the terms of the federal program,” Eyre said. With this announcement, she noted these two collaborative agreements will hopefully increase Indigenous contractors’ and workers’ participation in the oil and gas sector. “Our Indigenous partners will play a crucial role in Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.”
According to this week’s news release, the fund will allocate $15 million towards abandonment and reclamation activities on First Nations lands across Saskatchewan. Eligible licencees with oil and gas sites on reserves can access the fund by nominating sites for consideration. Licencees will engage with First Nations to ensure the perspective of those communities are reflected in site closure work.
If nomination numbers are sufficient, then the province will make available a further $5 million. The Indigenous Business Credit Pool will create an incentive for eligible licencees to work with First Nations and Métis contractors to complete program work. If companies collectively spend $30 million of existing ASCP allocations utilizing Indigenous oilfield services firms, then they will be eligible to access a further $15 million in ASCP funding for site closure work.
The First Nations Natural Resource Centre of Excellence (COE) will review applicants for eligibility under the program, for whose delivery the province is providing support, as the COE works with the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), licensees, oil and gas service companies, as well as First Nations communities, to administer the First Nations Stewardship Fund and the Indigenous Business Credit Pool.
Listening to First Nations
Heather Bear, vice-chair of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN), stated the ASCP not only helps First Nations businesses participate in well-reclamation work, but this further helps alleviate environmental concerns within treaty and traditional lands. “A critical focus for our chiefs and leadership is increased inclusion with regards to initiatives such as the ASCP in Saskatchewan.”
Indigenous communities within Canada are often “edited out of so many conversations” regarding government decisions surrounding oil and gas projects and determining the importance of energy, according to Eyre. She noted the views of Indigenous communities that supported such projects as Northern Gateway and Keystone XL were dismissed when those projects effectively were cancelled.
“I’ve spoken in rooms where there were literally a thousand First Nations voices who were in favour of energy projects,” she told the CAODC audience. “We have to be more unified about that, and stop being so condescending, frankly, about what they want in terms of energy, and what it means for communities.”
During Tuesday’s webinar, Mark Scholz, the CAODC’s president and chief executive officer, suggested that “true reconciliation” means, in part, self-determination for Indigenous Canadians, who want to provide for their families and the communities in which they live. “That, in so many ways, is aligned with the interests of our sector.”
Advocating for Canadian energy
According to Eyre, Canada’s federal government has “sort of reconciled itself” to U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent decision to rescind a key permit necessary for Keystone XL. She said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau likely is going to lean into similar ideologies with the Biden administration — which is fine to a degree — although it could leave a certain gap in terms of those issues that are of particular interest to Canada.
“Where that leaves us in terms of the broader advocacy for all those things that are really, really important to the energy sector, it’s down to the energy sector to a certain extent, and to Saskatchewan and Alberta to keep advocating.”
In terms of the federal government, Eyre said that she “certainly hopes” it is actively mobilizing on the issue of Michigan’s governor trying to shut down Enbridge Inc.’s 68-year-old Line 5 serving consumers in Central Canada.
Saskatchewan’s energy minister is also “a bit of a skeptic” in terms of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion now concluding without further obstacles. “I worry about the last miles on that project, and how all that will play out.”

Cost Of Keyera KAPS Pipeline Forecast To Rise To $1.6 Billion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Increased competitive pressures from other pipeline construction projects in Western Canada have increased the forecast gross cost of the Keyera Access Pipeline System (KAPS) pipeline to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion, Keyera Corp. said today.
The company’s 50 per cent net share of the project is approximately $800 million with completion scheduled for 2023. 
Returns for the project are underpinned by contracts for more then 70 per cent of the initial pipeline capacity with take-or-pay contracts with an average term of 14 years, Jamie Urquhart, vice-president of marketing capacity, said in a conference call to discuss 2020 fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results. After deferring KAPS for a year, Keyera has continued to advance project planning and expects to make as final investment decision (FID) on the project by this summer.
Based on discussions with customers in the last three to six months, the company expects to offset the higher cost with additional contracts, he said. “Our intent is not to pass through the increased capital cost to our shippers.”
“Overall, we still believe the project is needed for the basin; there's need for competition,” said Dean Setoguchi, Keyera’s new president and chief executive officer.
“If you look at the bigger macro, certainly we're seeing much better fundamentals, as you can see in the forward markets and in the spot markets for both natural gas and crude oil,” he said. “And we also think that propane is, is going to be pretty robust in the years to come.”
And while Keyera’s customers currently are repairing their balance sheets, in the future they plan to expand their programs, said Setoguchi. “And I think part of the bottlenecks that we've historically had in our basin all relates to egress.”
 NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) is expanding its system and Coastal GasLink to LNG on the West Coast will be in service towards the middle of this decade, which is only another four years out, he pointed out. On the crude oil side, there also are expansions for Trans Mountain and Enbridge Inc. Line 3 and the elimination of other small body bottlenecks, said Setoguchi.
“That really frees up a lot of the reserves that can hit the market, both for crude oil and natural gas.”
Many of the other large pipeline projects draw on the same resources that Keyera would be using, said Brad Lock, chief operating officer and senior vice-president.
“The nice thing is, we are in the process of securing all of our contractors for the construction activity and making sure that we are ready to hit the numbers that we have landed on right here,” he said. “So, we have strong confidence in those numbers to execute through to 2023.”

Macro Signs General Construction Contract With Trans Mountain | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Macro Enterprises Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Macro Projects Inc. (MPI), has entered into a general construction contract for interim work with Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. relating to certain segments of Spread 5B of the Trans Mountain expansion project.
The Spread 5B segments awarded to MPI involve a combination of clearing, grading and pipeline construction along the Coquihalla-Hope corridor in British Columbia.
The contract provides for MPI to continue with certain construction activities in Spread 5B on an interim basis to complete a portion of the scope of work specified under a previous contract.
Macro expects the contract will continue until a replacement general construction contractor is chosen and a new replacement contract is entered into, expected within the next three months. The contract has an initial estimated value that exceeds $50 million.
In December, Macro Enterprises Inc. reported that Macro Spiecapag Trans Mountain Joint Venture, its 50/50 joint venture with Spiecapag Canada Corp., received a notice of termination from Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. to “terminate for cause” the construction contract for Spread 5B of the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline project due to ongoing challenges between the joint venture and Trans Mountain.

Senator Manchin Urges Biden To Reverse Opposition To Keystone XL Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– The head of the U.S. Senate energy committee, Joe Manchin, on Tuesday urged President Joe Biden to reverse his opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, saying the project provides union jobs and is safer than transporting the oil via trucks and trains.
Biden revoked a permit for the pipeline which would transport 830,000 bbls/d of crude from Alberta to Nebraska. It was part of a flurry of Biden's executive orders aimed at curbing climate change.
In a letter to fellow Democrat Biden, the West Virginia senator said that even without the pipeline, the oil would still find its way to the United States by rail and truck, and pointed to U.S. data showing those methods result in more spills than pipelines.
""Pipelines continue to be the safest mode to transport our oil and natural gas resources and they support thousands of high-paying, American union jobs,"" Manchin said.
Opponents of TC Energy Corporation’s pipeline project say building such infrastructure would lock in decades of dependence on oil, making it harder to transition to clean energy.
Manchin said he supports “responsible"" energy infrastructure development including the Mountain Valley pipeline, which would take natural gas from Manchin's state to Virginia.
That project, led by Equitrans Midstream Corp., is one of several pipelines that have been delayed by regulatory and legal fights with states and environmental groups.
Fourteen attorneys general, led by Austin Knudsen of Montana, also urged Biden in a separate letter to reverse his decision on the Keystone permit.
Manchin’s support for big pipelines underscores the difficulty that Biden could have moving wide-ranging climate legislation through Congress given Democrats have only the slimmest possible majority in the Senate.

CER Allows Trans Mountain To Proceed With Burnaby Tree Clearing | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC may proceed with cutting nearly 1,200 trees on municipal and private lands within the city of Burnaby in the absence of a tree cutting permit from the city, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has ruled.  
However, that does not absolve the company from compliance with other relevant municipal bylaws, including any other section of its tree bylaw that otherwise remains applicable and operative, said the commission, which will issue its reasons later.
Under Burnaby’s trees bylaw, parties that remove trees are required to plant replacement trees with the number based on the size of the tree that is removed.
Citing the urgent need to keep the expansion project on schedule, Trans Mountain in a notice of motion had asked the CER to lift an approval condition that it obtain tree cutting permits from the city of Burnaby for project-related tree clearing after the city said it would not issue the permits. The commission said it has decided to grant, in substantial form, the relief sought in the motion.
The tree clearing entails the removal of trees, including on the project right-of-way and temporary workspace, as necessary to accommodate project construction. Trees that fall within those areas must be removed while all adjacent trees will be protected to the extent practical and safe.
The CER decision follows a recent hearing on the constitutionality of Burnaby’s refusal to issue the permit.
Trans Mountain said it anticipates tree clearing will require the removal of approximately 1,189 trees greater than 20 centimetres in diameter. The total includes 735 on private lands and 454 on municipal lands.
The company had a sought a decision from the CER by mid-January. The company says the city has said it will not issue the permit to cut nearly 1,200 trees which is required under a municipal tree bylaw.
A spokesperson for Trans Mountain said Monday that the company has not started tree removal in Burnaby and is restarting the expansion project in a phased approach. Workers in both Burnaby and Edson will be receiving safety re-training and re-orientation before construction on the ground begins.

Work Resumes On Trans Mountain Expansion Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Following a voluntary review of safety and workplace practices, the Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC expansion project has begun the restart process for construction, the company said Monday.
A staged remobilization of the company’s 7,000-strong workforce will begin this week. The restart process will begin with the safety re-training and re-orientation of all supervisors and workers before construction resumes.
In the wake of two serious workplace incidents that took place in late 2020, Trans Mountain executed a voluntary safety stand down and undertook a thorough review and examination of all workplace safety protocols and practices. The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) and other regulators continue to independently examine these events and Trans Mountain is working in full co-operation with their respective inquiries.
As part of the safety stand down process and the investigations into the incidents, the company and its contractors identified opportunities for enhancements to safety measures, some of which may have been contributing factors to the events of the past few months, said Trans Mountain. The company focused on and reviewed matters of compliance, communication, near-miss worksite reviews and reporting and workers’ fitness for duty, as a post-incident investigation revealed an isolated case of a worker failing a drug and alcohol test.
In response to the review of safety programs within Trans Mountain and with its contractors, the company said its board and senior leadership have taken immediate steps to enhance the safety culture to ensure the company’s workplace practices and procedures are of the highest safety standards with workplace safety the highest priority.
The restart process will begin with the safety re-training and re-orientation of all supervisors and workers before construction resumes.
Specific enhancements to Trans Mountain’s safety procedures include:

More rigorous job site safety training, particularly regarding the safe operation of equipment in proximity to other workers and communication between workers;
Enhanced worksite inspections and regular audits;
Rigorous incident and near-miss reporting supported by corrective action plans and systems;
Upgraded communications equipment and protocols for its effective operation on job sites;
Strengthened site supervision and the identification of daily site safety champions;
Better prior safety planning around higher-risk work, including the completion of detailed worksite plans to control personnel movements, heavy equipment locations and supervisory responsibilities;
Augmented fitness for duty assessments, including drug and alcohol testing; and
Increased hiring and training of personnel specifically responsible for ensuring safety during higher-risk work and day-to-day operations.

Trans Mountain said it is dedicated to the safety of its employees, suppliers and stakeholders and is committed to ensuring all safety management systems are in place, including COVID-19 protocols, to make sure everyone returns to work safely. Every worker returning to the project will undergo a COVID-19 test and a fitness for duty test before being allowed on a job site.

Alaska Seeks To Build Natural Gas Pipeline From North Slope To Fairbanks | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Alaska wants to start on the first phase of the state’s liquefied natural gas export plant and pipeline project by seeking federal funding and working with a private firm to build a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope to Fairbanks.
The proposed $5.9 billion pipeline would run roughly 800 kilometres and could start delivering gas into central Alaska in 2025, according to a report Frank Richards, president of the Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC), presented to the board on Thursday.
Richards said the companies would seek federal stimulus or infrastructure funding that could cover about 75 per cent of the cost of the first phase and help attract outside investment. AGDC did not name the private company but called it “a major pipeline developer.”
""Phase One of the Alaska LNG project is poised to quickly put thousands of people to work,"" Richards said, noting the federal stimulus money would be used to stimulate the economy, clean the air and lower energy bills
The total $38.7 billion project includes a 1,298-kilometre pipeline with the capacity to transport 3.3 billion cubic feet per day to a liquefaction plant in Nikiski on the Kenai Peninsula.
The plan has been in the works for a long time. Alaska signed an agreement with major oil and gas companies to build the project in 2014, but the state ended up taking over its development in 2016 after the oil companies backed out.
Since then, AGDC received federal authorization to build the project in May 2020 and signed agreements with BP plc and Exxon Mobil Corporation to help advance its development.
BP and Exxon produce massive amounts of oil in Alaska and have discovered huge gas resources that are stranded in the North Slope. Alaska LNG would give that gas access to global markets.

"Line 5 Shutdown ‘Low Probability Event,’ Says Suncor CEO | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
A shutdown of Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5 is a “low probability event,” according to Suncor Energy Inc. president and CEO Mark Little.
“With Line 5, we believe [a] shutdown is a very low probability event,” he told Suncor’s Q4 and 2020 results conference call this morning. 
“It serves many consumers, both in Central Canada, Quebec, and Ontario, as well as Michigan, and Ohio. So, you know, we think it’s very important to those economies.”
He added: “But one of the things we have is we have this Portland pipeline, which we now own exclusively, that allows us to bring waterborne crudes into Montreal. So, if it turns out that we had a risk, we think we’re better positioned than anybody in this market to keep our refineries moving forward and get crude to them either through waterborne crudes coming into Montreal or using what pipeline capacity we have without Line 5 getting into Ontario.
“So, you know, we think we’re much stronger positioned than anybody else in that market. And as a result of that, if they constrain the market, we think that we’ll get more than enough from the market to be able to pay for any efficiency or … squeeze that you get on the crude side going into the refineries. So, we feel that we have a very good risk management position there, even though we see it as a very low probability event.”
Imperial Oil Limited also discussed Line 5 this week. Line 5, which transports oil and natural gas liquids, is a critical piece of infrastructure.
Therefore the company’s president and CEO Brad Corson noted that his company is watching “very closely” as the Michigan governor tries to shut down the 68-year-old line, which received state environmental agency approval to build an underground tunnel to house a replacement for the pipeline.
“While we think a shutdown of that pipeline is very low-probability, we’re developing appropriate contingency plans that would allow us to supply our refineries in Ontario … with alternate sources of crude oil, both through the seaway as well as through other pipelines and available rail alternatives,” Corson noted.

TSB Investigation Determines Cause Of April 2020 Oil Spill At Saskatchewan Pump Station | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) investigation determined that no significant impact to water or wildlife occurred due to an incident in which crude leaked from Enbridge Pipelines Inc.’s Hershel pump station east of Hershel, Sask., on April 30, 2020.
During the week of the incident, local temperatures cycled from below freezing at night to above freezing during the day. Commissioned in 1972, the pump station services Enbridge’s Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 67, and 93, all of which are regulated by the Canada Energy Regulator (CER).
On April 29, field operators did not observe any leaking components before leaving the site at about 4 p.m. At the time, Line 3 at the pump station was under a scheduled shutdown. Later that evening, the operations control centre in Edmonton restarted the pipeline at about 9:46 p.m., shutting it down again around 11:05 p.m. Control centre operators did not see abnormal conditions during this start-up or shutdown.
However, when field operators arrived on site the next morning, they discovered the release from a flexible braided hose, which is part of an above-ground auxiliary system used to inject drag reducing agents (DRA) into Line 3.
Before installing the DRA injection system at the pump station, the company performed a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) and Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) as part of its risk management process, but the HAZOP did not identify how DRA injection-system design allows crude to backflow from the injection point to the check valve.
Therefore, the HAZOP failed to identify that, should the piping, including the flexible braided hose, freeze and rupture, there could be a release. As such, Enbridge, prior to the incident, had not implemented control measures to prevent crude oil from release due to a failure of either the piping or the flexible braided hose.
Fortunately, crews recovered the released product, including the affected off-site soils, which were treated at an approved facility. Following the incident, Enbridge initiated a review of its storm-water management procedures and documentation to identify areas for improvements. The company also developed procedures to flush operated DRA injection systems to prevent blockages and freezing.
Enbridge also revised its standard DRA injection-system design to locate the check valve downstream of the flexible braided hose. Further, the company revised the preventative maintenance procedures for DRA injection systems and their components.

Alberta Government Funding Acceleration Of Emissions-Reduction Tech | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Alberta government has announced nearly $2 million in funding to help accelerate the adoption of new technologies—electrification, artificial intelligence, machine learning—that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the pipeline transportation of Alberta’s natural gas.
Funds will be provided to Gazoduq Inc. through Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA). The $4 million project will evaluate the feasibility of using electrification, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to decarbonize natural gas pipelines from Alberta to Quebec. This investment supports the Alberta government’s natural gas vision and strategy by helping to improve competitiveness and create economic opportunities for the natural gas sector.
Gazoduq’s project will assess the feasibility of using renewable energy to power large scale electric drives for three compressors used in the transmission of natural gas. At 40 megawatts each, the electrification of compressors at this scale would be first of its kind globally, according to an ERA release. At compression stations where renewable electricity is not feasible, cogeneration (using waste heat) will be explored.
A potential application of the technology is a proposed transportation pipeline from Alberta through TC Energy Corporation's existing Canadian Mainline before connecting to a new transmission line proposed from Northern Ontario to a LNG facility in Saguenay, Quebec. If proven successful, the new technology could cut up to 1.8 million tonnes of GHG emissions in Quebec by 2030.
If this approach is adopted in Alberta at six 30-megawatt compression stations, cumulative GHG reductions of approximately 440,000 tonnes of CO2e could be achieved by 2030. If rollout of the technology is expanded to 26 units as expected, a cumulative reduction of 6.7 million tonnes can be achieved by 2040.
The proposed transportation pipeline would allow for the export of approximately 1.6 bcf/d of Alberta natural gas. The project could also provide an opportunity to deliver natural gas to remote communities along the route, with the participation of local distributers, and allow Alberta to export its natural gas to European and Asian markets, expanding economic opportunities for the natural gas sector and replacing more polluting forms of energy such as coal.
The project is also expected to result in capacity building for Universal Pegasus International’s Alberta office, leading to increased job creation in the Alberta construction sector if the approach is adopted in-province.

"Imperial Maintains Egress Optionality, But CEO Still Disappointed With KXL Decision | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Imperial Oil Limited had some capacity reserved on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which had its presidential permit revoked by President Joe Biden.  
Despite this revocation by the new president, Imperial’s top brass says the company has other egress options, so it will likely not run into any constraints.
“Nonetheless, we prefer to maximize flexibility, and so the fact this has been cancelled is quite unfortunate,” Brad Corson, president and chief executive officer, told Tuesday’s Q4 2020 results conference call. For the Canadian energy sector and nation as a whole, he said, Biden’s decision on KXL is disappointing.
“It’s in our best interest as an industry and as a country to ensure there’s sufficient egress opportunity for the crude that’s produced here. It’s important to have optionality in the market for producers. Cancellation of the pipeline permit is quite unfortunate because of the limitations that it’ll cause, because of the jobs it affects, and so on. I’m hopeful we can continue to find a positive way forward.”
Meanwhile, last week, the U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to throw out a key federal permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), ordering a lengthy environmental review to determine whether the pipeline can keep operating, raising chances Energy Transfer’s 557,000 bbl/d pipeline will be shut pending this review.
“We’re not directly impacted if DAPL were to shut down, because we don’t transport any crude on that pipeline to feed our refineries,” Corson said, adding Imperial could be indirectly impacted as a shutdown might force the Bakken producers using that line to seek other egress alternatives that could affect regional light crude differentials.
“Under most scenarios, you would probably imagine that those differentials would widen, and that would benefit our refineries because we do run predominantly light crude feedstocks. We’re obviously keeping a close look at this, as we have for the last many months, as there has been some uncertainty around this pipeline.”
For Imperial, Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5, which transports oil and natural gas liquids, is a more critical piece of infrastructure. Therefore, Corson noted, his Canadian company is watching “very closely” as the Michigan governor tries to shut down the 68-year-old line, which received state environmental agency approval to build an underground tunnel to house a replacement for the pipeline.
“While we think a shutdown of that pipeline is very low-probability, we’re developing appropriate contingency plans that would allow us to supply our refineries in Ontario … with alternate sources of crude oil, both through the seaway as well as through other pipelines and available rail alternatives.”
Regarding crude-by-rail, the CEO suggested 2020 saw a lot of volatility, with highs early last year of 300,000 bbls/d moved via train, falling to minimal levels in the back half of the year. With differentials widening, he told Tuesday’s conference call, the crude-by-rail numbers out of Western Canada are again rising. “As we look at those differentials, it’s in the range of being economic for some increase in rail movements.”
Imperial is also starting to ramp up some movements on rail, said Corson. “In the near-term, we’re probably at the 30,000-to-40,000-barrel-per-day range, and obviously we’ll continue to assess the economics of that going forward.”
He added: “There’s a lot of flexibility around rail, around storage, and around pipelines, and so that will keep the system well in balance, and has also reinforced the decision by the government to remove curtailment, of which we’re very supportive.”

Biden Revokes Oil Drilling Permits For Additional Review | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– The Biden administration is revoking dozens of invalid drilling permits issued by agency workers without the approval of political appointees, despite a temporary order for such reviews.
The Interior Department on Friday notified affected oil and gas producers that roughly 70 permits governing onshore wells were improperly issued and that the companies need to seek new approvals.
Although the companies may swiftly obtain the new authorizations, the move is likely to further sour relations between the Biden administration and the oil industry, which is bearing the brunt of the president’s early efforts to fight climate change. President Joe Biden cancelled a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline his first day in office, and on Wednesday he ordered a pause in the sale of new oil and gas leases on federal land.
The drilling permits fell afoul of a temporary Interior Department order that for two months puts those decisions in the hands of top agency officials, rather than delegating them to workers in Bureau of Land Management offices around the country.
“Approximately 70 permits were approved without proper review following the issuance of a department directive that temporarily elevates review of permitting activities,” said Interior spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. “Operators have been notified that those applications for permits to drill must be resubmitted for appropriate and timely review. Interior continues to approve permits and will transmit final decisions as soon as possible.”
The approvals were invalid under the Interior Department’s Jan. 20 secretarial order requiring agency brass to authorize drilling permits, easements, hiring and other decisions, according to a notification letter seen by Bloomberg News.
Companies also are being assured they do not face penalties for any drilling or other activities they started under the invalidated permits, though they are being ordered to cease those operations while seeking new approvals.
Top Interior Department officials have used the temporary new process to approve dozens of drilling permits since Jan. 20, when Biden was inaugurated. At least 33 have been authorized for offshore oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a Bloomberg News review of government data.
The permit changes are separate from a government pause on new oil and gas leasing that was ordered by Biden on Wednesday. That leasing moratorium doesn’t affect permitting and other activity on existing oil and gas leases.

"Once United In Support Of Biden, Environmentalists And Unions Clash Over Pipelines | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– Environmentalists and labour unions that threw their support behind U.S. President Joe Biden now find themselves on the opposite sides of a battle over the construction of big pipeline projects between Canada and the United States.
While climate activists celebrated Keystone XL’s demise, labour unions, reeling from the global oil downturn, have mobilized to keep ongoing projects from being derailed.
Mike Knisely, secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, which endorsed Biden, said he has been leaning on state officials to talk to the president about how his rapid-fire climate announcements are affecting his union membership's support.
""I tell them they need to get back with Biden and ask if this all really has to happen on Day Two of the new administration,"" Knisely said. ""I just get so frustrated that there's almost no common ground [on pipelines] with the environmental community.""
Climate groups have had successes in recent years, persuading large investors to reduce holdings in fossil fuel industries, as well as lobbying banks to shun investment in Arctic drilling.
But Biden was endorsed by a number of key labour unions that work on pipelines, refineries and other energy installations, including the International Teamsters and North America's Building Trades. Those unions celebrated the victory of a pro-labour president, but opposed the Keystone move, and are lining up against threats to the other pipelines.
Environmentalists see Biden as an ally in the battle to wean the United States off fossil fuels and stymie imports of heavy crude from Canada's oilsands. They are intensifying efforts to shut three other pipelines: Enbridge Inc. Line 3 and Line 5, and Energy Transfer's Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).
Unlike KXL, these three lines are all currently in service.
Legal and regulatory battles threaten all three pipelines.
A White House spokesman said the Biden administration is reviewing a court decision last week that upheld orders for a lengthy environmental review for DAPL. He declined to comment on the two Enbridge pipelines.
Enbridge is more than doubling Line 3's capacity to 760,000 bbls/d, a project supported by Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat.
To be sure, not all unions backed Biden. Phillip Wallace, business representative for Pipeliners Union 798 in Minnesota, said his union, which supported former president Donald Trump, was concerned the new administration may try to stop the project.
""We have got full construction going right now in Minnesota and I am worried that this new administration could throw a monkey wrench in our gears,"" Wallace said. His union is planning on rallies to support construction once COVID-19 restrictions ease.
On Friday, environmental protesters halted construction on a Line 3 work site in Minnesota by locking themselves to each other between barrels of concrete, one of several disruptions so far this year that has resulted in dozens of arrests.
""If KXL can't pass the climate test for Biden, Line 3 certainly can't,"" said Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, an Indigenous environmental group.
Unions are also ramping up support for Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which runs under the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan meet, and ships 540,000 bbls/d of light crude and propane. Activists want to decommission the 68-year-old line, while Enbridge is trying to upgrade it to protect the straits.
Enbridge last week received a state permit to build a tunnel to house the line; it still needs permission from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

CER Wraps Up Hearing On Request For TSP Extension | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Extension of the Temporary Service Protocol (TSP) is a prudent and measured step to protect against disruptions and inefficiencies on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) System in 2021, counsel for the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) said Thursday.
“On this record, we feel even more strongly that there will be curtailments over the upcoming summer, and for that reason, there is a risk that must be addressed,” Laurie Smith said in reply argument at the final day of oral arguments before the Canada Energy Regulator (CER).
EPAC wants the regulator to extend the expiry date for the tariff by one year to Oct. 31, 2021, or until the NGTL 2021 system expansion receives leave to open.
The first-time experimental Transfers to Storage pilot proposed by NGTL is no substitute for the TSP, especially not for only a few months during the summer of 2021, he told the commission.
NGTL implemented the TSP while completing construction and other maintenance activities which were required in the same timeframe, and all parties knew it was being employed, and so the market disruptions and dislocations were avoided, he said. “That’s the outcome the commission and the proponents of the TSP had hoped for. It worked.”
Smith acknowledged that the CER decision stipulated that the TSP was meant to be temporary and was to expire Oct. 31, 2020. However, the NGTL 2021 was delayed and it wasn’t necessary to activate it in 2020, although it was available to be immediately utilized, which itself was reassuring to the market.
Record injections took place, “proving what happens when there are no curtailments of downstream of James River storage injections by means of IT-S [storage] service curtailments,” he said.  
The TSP is just and reasonable in the Canadian public interest, as a temporary amendment to the curtailment methodology which the commission in its RH-002-2019 decision found was less disruptive and more efficient than the standard protocol which preceded it, said Smith. “And under no circumstances do we believe those findings were in any way undermined in the course of this proceeding.”
He challenged the suggestion by several intervenors that the reconnection of the AECO prices in October 2019 was due to the 2019 and 2020 capacity additions. The use of storage is driven by storage spreads, not capacity additions and as counsel for Rockpoint Gas Storage suggested, the fact storage may be empty is going to throw off some price signals, which will lead to its partial or complete refilling, said Smith.
The fact that the TSP was not required in 2020 demonstrates the benefits of the TSP protections rather than argues against them, he said.
Counsel for Ovinitiv Canada ULC, NuVista Energy Ltd. and Seven Generations Energy Ltd. also had argued that the TSP shouldn’t be used as an insurance policy, to protect IT service from interruption.
However, IT-S service is the only way to get in and out of storage so it can’t be firmed up, making it unlike any other interruptible service, according to Smith. “Without the TSP, under curtailment conditions, we would be deprived of a significant part of the market which, ironically, Ovintiv’s counsel tells us we need to let function.”

Cenovus CEO Says Merger With Husky Mutes Blow Of Keystone | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Cenovus Energy Inc.’s merger with Husky Energy Inc. is diminishing the blow from U.S. President Joe Biden’s move last week to revoke of the permit needed to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried some 830,000 bbls/d of Alberta oilsands crude to Nebraska.
Speaking to analysts and reporters during a conference call Thursday to discuss the company’s 2021 capital budget, Alex Pourbaix, president and CEO, said the merged company’s bulked-up upstream-downstream integrated model and infrastructure means Cenovus is less impacted by the pipeline project’s cancelation than many of its peers.
“I think in terms of our company it’s a relatively muted impact and made all the more so because of the combination of Husky and Cenovus,” he said.
“One of the obvious benefits of that combination is it massively reduced — legacy Cenovus — our exposure to egress challenges out of the province. If you take a look at the production that we have versus the egress options that we have in the combined company, for the large, large majority of our production we can find a home for and we’re no longer having to sell at Hardisty or elsewhere in Alberta and be exposed to that light-heavy diff in the province.”
For the Canadian industry as a whole, though, Pourbaix said the Biden administration’s decision to nix Keystone XL is a “tragedy” that was not based on the well-scrutinized merits of the project and overlooked the benefit to both countries.
“This is probably — not probably [but] certainly —the most exhaustingly reviewed project in the history of pipelines from an environmental perspective. It was repeatedly found by the U.S. State Department to have no material, serious risks to the environment,” he said.
“You’re already seeing the impact of thousands of workers in Canada and the U.S. losing their jobs and I think that’s a tragedy.”
Despite ths, Pourbaix said Canadian heavy oil producers still have legitimate hope going forward as other pipeline projects continue to progress.
“I would say there are many options for producers to get out of the province. We see TMX and we see Line 3 going ahead and, obviously, those are positive counterpoints to [KXL]. But it certainly was not happy news and I think unnecessary and unwarranted and damaging for both countries.”
A Biden presidency could provide opportunity for Canadian E&Ps
Pourbaix said that with Biden rubber-stamping numerous executive orders, opportunity may exist for Canada’s oil and gas sector to benefit as the U.S. industry grapples with a bevy of new rules.
“I think that’s part of the story and obviously the other part of the story is with this pandemic the massive disruption in capital spending by the upstream businesses in the Lower 48. The combination of both of these events will ultimately, I think, create the opportunity for a positive situation for Canadian heavy,” he said.
“On that point, I would say one of the things we’re finding really interesting is very, very strong demand for the heavies down in the U.S., and frankly offshore,” Pourbaix added.
“So, all of that sort of directionally bodes well. I, for one, don’t think anyone in our industry would take any pleasure from seeing our industry peers having challenges, whether it’s by political decree or otherwise. But, yeah, I think directionally those are helpful for the Canadian industry.”
Asked by an analyst if Cenovus could pursue growth projects at Foster Creek and Christina Lake (FCCL) given the unfolding circumstances south of the border, Pourbaix reiterated the company line that the focus is on repairing the balance sheet, rather than growth.
“As for whether that would cause us to accelerate development of any of the future FCCL opportunities, I know I sound like a broken record but it’s going to depend on our balance sheet and it’s going to depend on egress availability out of the province,” he said.
“We’re feeling relatively constructive on both those [projects] … But we’ve been banging on a drum pretty hard and it is balance sheet, balance sheet, balance sheet. And that’s where our focus is going to be, at least until we get comfortably below that $10 billion number.”
Cenovus is allocating free funds flow to reduce its net debt to less than $10 billion and targeting a longer-term net debt level at or below $8 billion.

Michigan Approves Great Lakes Oil Pipeline Tunnel Permits | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– Michigan's environmental agency said Friday it has approved construction of an underground tunnel to house a replacement for a controversial oil pipeline in a channel linking two of the Great Lakes.
The decision, a victory for Enbridge Inc., comes as the company resists Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's demand to shut down its 68-year-old line in the Straits of Mackinac.
Enbridge disputes her claim –– echoed by environmentalists and native tribes –– that the pipeline segment crossing 6.4-kilometre-wide waterway is unsafe. But Enbridge had earlier sought to ease public concern by striking a deal with Whitmer’s predecessor, Republican Rick Snyder, in 2018 to run a new pipe through a tunnel to be drilled beneath the straits connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.
The project requires permits from the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Liesl Clark, director of the Michigan agency and a Whitmer appointee, said the company's application satisfied state legal requirements.
“We have issued permits designed to ensure that if a tunnel is constructed, it will be in strict compliance with relevant statutes and adhere to stringent protections against impacts to the Great Lakes,” Clark said.
Enbridge has pledged to cover all costs of the $500 million project, which it says will be completed by 2024.
The tunnel “will make a safe pipeline even safer,'' spokesman Ryan Duffy said, describing the permit approval as “an important milestone'' for a project “virtually eliminating the potential for any release from Line 5 into the straits.''
Environmental groups and tribes fighting to decommission Enbridge's Line 5, which transports oil and natural gas liquids used in propane between Superior and Sarnia also oppose the tunnel. They say it would pollute the waters, harm fish and damage shoreline wetlands while boosting use of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.
The permit approval is ""a huge disappointment,'' said Liz Kirkwood, executive director of Traverse City-based For Love of Water, saying there was “compelling evidence of significant environmental harm.”
""There are much smarter alternatives to building a tunnel under the largest freshwater body on the planet,'' Kirkwood said, adding that the decision probably would draw legal challenges.
State officials emphasized that the tunnel project was a separate legal matter from the dispute over the existing pipeline, which was laid in 1953. The underwater segment splits into two pipes, 20 inches (50.8 centimetres) in diameter, stretched across the bottom of the straits.
Critics contend the pipes are vulnerable to a rupture that could contaminate Great Lakes waters and miles of shorelines, a hazard that became more urgent after a barge anchor was dragged across them in 2018, doing minor damage.
Whitmer last fall ordered a shutdown of Line 5 by May, saying Enbridge repeatedly had violated an easement allowing pipeline operations in the straits. The company is challenging the order in federal court and said recently it would not comply.
Enbridge insists the lines have never leaked and remain in good condition. It has taken steps to prevent future anchor strikes and says the tunnel project would eliminate that danger.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel unsuccessfully challenged in court a law authorizing the tunnel agreement that was enacted shortly before Snyder's term as governor expired.
Opponents then urged rejection of permits for the project. Engineers who studied the company's application documents at the request of environmental groups said Enbridge hadn't taken enough core samples and that uneven bedrock formations could lead to boring machine breakdowns.
They also raised warned about potential collapse of the tunnel, methane leaks that could endanger workers, and bentonite clay used for lubrication and stability that could pollute the lakes and bottomlands if released.
Leaders of the state environment department said they hired a consulting firm with tunneling expertise to assist a nine-month review of Enbridge's plans that included consideration of critics' objections.
It found the project would have “minimal impact'' on water quality and wetlands, said Teresa Seidel, director of the department's Water Resources Division. State law didn't allow for consideration of the project's potential effects on climate change, she said.
One permit allows Enbridge to build the tunnel beneath submerged lands and to disturb wetlands on the north shore of the straits, where a road will be widened.
About 0.13 wetland acres (0.052 hectares), an area the size of one-tenth of a football field, would be damaged. Enbridge will compensate by conserving 1.3 wetland acres (0.53 hectares) and supporting other protections.
A second permit will regulate wastewater from the project, which will be treated at an onshore plant. About 5.3 million litres will be discharged daily into the lakes and will have to meet quality standards, including heat limitations, to protect fish and other aquatic life.
Enbridge must notify the state if the plant exceeds 65 per cent of its operating capacity. If it hits 100 per cent, construction work will be halted.
The project still needs a Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps. Among issues for federal consideration is the recent discovery of a possible underwater Native American cultural site in the area of the pipeline. The state permit requires avoidance of damage to such sites.
Additionally, the state Public Service Commission will decide whether to allow placement of the new pipe in the tunnel.

"Environmentalists, Farmers Win Dutch Court Case Over Shell Nigeria Spills | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
 (Reuters) — A Dutch appeals court on Friday held Royal Dutch Shell plc’s Nigerian subsidiary responsible for multiple oil pipeline leaks in the Niger Delta and ordered it to pay unspecified damages to farmers, in a victory for environmentalists.
The case was brought in 2008 by four farmers and environmental group Friends of the Earth, seeking reparations for lost income from contaminated land and waterways in the region, the heart of Nigeria's oil industry.
Although only Shell subsidiary SPDC was found to be directly responsible, the Dutch ruling could open the door for more environmental cases against oil companies.
It also adds to Shell's legal woes. In November, it lost a Nigerian high court case that could lead to $44 million in damages for spills.
In March, a Milan court is set to deliver a verdict in one of the oil industry’s biggest ever corruption trials in Italy, involving Italy's Eni and Shell.
Friday's decision went a step further than a 2013 ruling by a lower court, saying that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary was responsible for multiple cases of oil pollution.
The appeals judge sided with the farmers in four of six spills covered by the lawsuit and postponed a verdict in the remaining cases, where the lower court had previously found SPDC responsible.
Shell said in a statement it continues to believe the spills were caused by sabotage.
""We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding that SPDC is liable.""
The appeals court said Shell had not proven ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the oil spills had been caused by sabotage, rather than poor maintenance.
""This makes Shell Nigeria responsible for the damage caused by the leaks,"" the court said.
Friends of the Earth said the ruling exceeded all expectations and marked the first time a multinational had been instructed by a Dutch court to uphold a duty of care for foreign operations.
The Dutch appeals court did not hold Shell's parent company, Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Shell, directly responsible, but ordered it to install a leak detection system on the Oruma pipeline, the source of several spills in the case.
""This is fantastic news for the environment and people living in developing countries,"" said Friends of the Earth's Netherlands head Donald Pols. It creates legal grounds to ""take on the multinationals who do them harm.""
Shell settled a similar case in a British court in 2015, agreeing to pay 70 million euros (US$85 million) to members of the Niger Delta Bodo community.
The spills addressed by the court case occurred between 2004 and 2007, but pollution from leaking oil pipelines remains a major problem in the Niger Delta.

Changed Circumstances Cited In Producers’ Opposition To TSP | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Circumstances have changed dramatically from 2019 when the Canadian Energy Regulator approved the Temporary Service Protocol on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) system, counsel for three gas producers told a hearing Wednesday on the proposed extension of the TSP.
“The argument being made by the Alberta government in 2019 was that the producing industry was in crisis, that there was extreme pricing instability, [and] that the TSP was urgently needed to enhance access to storage to stop prices from collapsing,” said Don Davies, who was representing Ovinitiv Canada ULC, NuVista Energy Ltd. and Seven Generations Energy Ltd.
“The objective wasn’t to have a protocol that was fair and reasonable amongst shippers. The objective wasn’t to have a protocol that appropriately balanced the benefits and burdens to the pipeline and the different shippers,” he said in final argument in opposing the application from the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada.
“The sole objective, right from the get-go, was simply to have a protocol that prioritized interruptible storage service [over firm receipt service].”  
The Alberta government sold the TSP to NGTL and to shippers on the basis that it would be a temporary measure to deal with the then exceptional price environment, said Davies.  It was only supposed to apply in the summers of 2019 and 2020.
Since then, NGTL has added about one bcf/d of expansion capacity, the basin has reconnected and AECO prices have stabilized, Davies said. There were no significant problems with access to storage in 2020 and none are expected in the summer of 2021, he noted.
EPAC, though, is seeking to have the expiry date for the tariff extended by one year to Oct. 31, 2021, or until the NGTL 2021 system expansion receives leave to open, citing the potential risk to storage access due to work on the delayed system expansion.  
“It is one thing for the commission to have approved the TSP in the context of the exceptional circumstances that existed in 2019,” Davies said. “It would be quite another thing for the commission to now approve an extension of the TSP, in the current environment, in order to provide an insurance policy to protect interruptible delivery services from restriction.”
According to Davies, while the onus is on EPAC to show that extending the TSP would be just and reasonable and in the public interest, it didn’t even address those matters in its file of application.
“EPAC’s approach in its application was essentially to say: ‘We are just applying to extend the temporary TSP, refer to the previous RH-002- 2019 decision for further details,’” he said.
The first problem with that, said Davies, is that the commission specifically said in its decision that approval of the TSP set no precedent for how curtailments would be treated after Oct. 31, 2020.
“The second and even bigger problem is that the RH-002-2019 decision didn’t address these matters either,” he said. “There was no assessment of the fairness and equity of the TSP amongst shippers. There was no assessment of the benefits versus the burdens of the TSP or of alternatives to the TSP.”
 That’s because the commission did not have before it the evidentiary record necessary to make those assessments, said Davies.
Because the TSP was used only in October 2019 and not in the summer of 2020, it’s not possible to say with absolute certainty that it by itself caused the market reconnection, he said.
“But while there may be doubt about the benefit that actually resulted from the TSP, there is no doubt about the burden that the TSP causes to FT-R [firm receipt] shippers,” Davies told the commission.
FT-R shippers are required to pay tolls for their service, whether their service is used or not, he said. Curtailing FT-R (receipt) in favour of IT-S (storage) and IT-D (delivery) means that FT-R shippers will continue to pay for service that they cannot fully use, he said.
However, producers such as his clients also carefully arrange their FT-R to accommodate their production requirements and to maximize the value of their production, according to Davies.
Curtailing FT-R can force the shut-in of gas to align to the FT-R percentage cut, resulting in a loss of production revenue and can disrupt commercial arrangements made to gather and process gas upstream of the NGTL system, he said. It can disrupt commercial arrangements made to transport, process, fractionate and sell the liquids extracted from the gas. It also can affect the ability of producers to use all of the NGTL FT-D (firm delivery) for which they have contracted.
 “These are all real, tangible adverse consequences that arise from the application of the TSP and the restriction of FT-R.”
Davies argued that fairness and equity should be the paramount principles to be applied when assessing how to prioritize services on NGTL as “there is no crisis or other compelling public interest reason to ignore fairness and equity this time around.”
The essential question is whether interruptible delivery and storage injection should be given priority over firm receipt services, he said. While the sole objective of the TSP was to enhance access to storage, to do so it prioritized IT- S over FT-R.
“But there is no way that such a result can be squared with principles of fairness and equity,” said Davies. NGTL builds facilities to provide receipt service, not interruptible storage, and while receipt customers make contractual commitments to NGTL, interruptible storage customers do not.
“Customers pay tolls for their receipt service; IT-S customers pay no tolls for their storage service,” he said. “How, on such facts, can it possibly be fair and equitable to give priority of service to IT-S customers over FT-R customers? It just can’t be.”
The proceeding wraps up today with final argument from EPAC.

CP Sees Near-Term Crude-By-Rail Opportunities As Pipeline Projects Hit Roadblocks | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited expects its crude-by-rail business will benefit from U.S. President Joe Biden’s formal revoking of the permit needed to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried some 830,000 bbls/d of Alberta oilsands crude to Nebraska.
“We think that this creates more support for scaling up and expansion of the DRU, and so we’re bullish on that opportunity,” Keith Creel, president and chief executive officer, told Wednesday’s Q4 2020 results conference call. While pipeline capacity will eventually “catch up” to meet the demand, he said, Biden’s decision means it will take longer to do so. Ultimately, he believes there are opportunities for both pipelines and crude-by-rail.
In December 2019, Gibson Energy Inc. and US Development Group LLC agreed to build and operate a diluent recovery unit (DRU) near Hardisty using the latter’s patented technology. The project was to take between 18 months and two years to complete. ConocoPhillips Canada contracted to process 50,000 bbls/d of inlet bitumen blend through the DRU, which CP and Kansas City Southern Railway Company would ship to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
“The most exciting part about the DRU is that scales up,” Creel said, adding the project is protected, it is “pipeline-competitive” and “environmentally competitive,” and it comes with 10-year contracts. “And so, across the board, that DRU piece is really, really exciting.
“Given the facility being build right now will come online by midyear, and we exclusively service it in Hardisty, and it’s scalable and can go up to twice as large as it is coming out of the gate, that’s really exciting.”
John Brooks, executive vice-president and chief marketing officer, said CP is also “watching closely” for Dakota Access pipeline updates. This week, a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision that throws out a key federal permit for the line and orders a lengthy environmental review determining if it can keep operating. The court’s ruling raises the chance that Energy Transfer’s 557,000-bbl/d pipeline could be shut pending environmental review.
“We do ship Bakken crude out of North Dakota, and obviously if something happened with that pipeline, then we think that would generate an opportunity.”
He added: “We’ve been able to generate some pretty stable crude-by-rail business out of North Dakota, but I think that certainly there’s an opportunity for upside if they were to move to shutting [Dakota Access] down or putting it on the sideline for a certain amount of time.”
Tough times for crude-by-rail
For the three and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2020, CP achieved revenue from the energy, chemicals and plastics segment (that includes crude-by-rail) of $366 million and $1.52 billion, respectively, which represents a decrease of 25 and one per cent from the comparative timeframes one year prior. The number of carloads for this segment was 80,600 and 308,800 in Q4 and full-year 2020, respectively, which is down 20 and 14 per cent from the same 2019 periods.
Unfavourable spreads weighed on crude-by-rail in 2020, with CP seeing some “very tough” comparables for Q4, said Brooks. Excluding crude, he noted, volumes moved in the energy, chemicals and plastics segment were up nine per cent in the quarter, with improving export and domestic demand for liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline and diesel.
“Looking at 2021, we’ll face tough crude [comparables] in Q1, but with the continued economic recovery we anticipate improved performance across our energy portfolio, and specifically in our refined products area.”
For crude-by-rail, he added, spreads become more favourable with increasing activity. Further, CP will be moving DRU crude volumes later this year from the exclusively-served facility at Hardisty. “These DRU volumes will provide a safer, pipeline-competitive option for shippers, and will help stabilize our crude business into the future.”
In its quarterly results released on Tuesday, Canadian National Railway Corporation reported revenue from the petroleum and chemicals segment (which includes crude-by-rail) in Q4 and full-year 2020 of $664 million and $2.63 billion, respectively, which is a drop of 12 and 14 per cent from the same 2019 periods. In Q4 and full-year 2020, CN moved about 155,000 and 597,000 petroleum and chemicals carloads, which is down eight and 13 per cent from 2019.
Q4 2020 results
Across all of its segments, the total number of carloads that CP moved in Q4 and full-year 2020 totalled 727,800 and 2.71 million, respectively, which is up four per cent and down two per cent from the same periods one year prior.
Meanwhile, CP’s revenue in Q4 and full-year 2020 totalled $2.01 billion and $7.71 billion, respectively, compared to $2.07 billion and $7.79 billion for the same 2019 periods. The firm achieved net income of $802 million and $2.444 billion during the three and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2020, respectively, compared to $664 million and $2.44 billion during the comparative timeframes one year prior.
“Despite the continued COVID-19 impacts, volumes steadily improved over the second half of 2020 and we saw revenue-ton-mile growth in the fourth quarter,” Creel said, adding pandemic-caused uncertainty dramatically disrupted global supply chains. For this year, though, CP’s planned capital expenditures total $1.55 billion
“By leveraging our unique growth opportunities and applying our precision-scheduled railroading operating model, CP is continuing to lead the industry. The momentum we’ve created in the fourth quarter will continue into 2021.”
CP announces proposed five-for-one share split; dividend declared
On Wednesday, CP announced its board of directors will seek shareholder and regulatory approval to implement a ‘five-for-one’ share split of the company’s issued and outstanding common shares, subject to shareholder approval at the April 21 annual general meeting (and to Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange requirements).
According to Creel, the company’s share-price value has increased 150 per cent in the past five years, and the share split will encourage greater liquidity of common shares and provide greater opportunities for ownership. If approved by shareholders and stock exchanges, and implemented by the board, shareholders are entitled to four additional common shares for each common share held at a date to be approved by the board following shareholder approval.
This week, CP’s board declared a quarterly dividend of 95 cents per share on the outstanding common shares. The dividend is payable on April 26, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 26. The five-for-one share split would not impact this dividend payment.
Also this week, CP announced the TSX has accepted its notice to implement a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to purchase, for cancellation, up to 3.33 million common shares issued and outstanding as at Jan. 15, 2021. This NCIB is scheduled to begin on Friday and is due to terminate on Jan. 28, 2022.
In connection with the NCIB, the company will enter into an automatic purchase plan with its designated broker to allow for common-share purchases during internal quarterly blackout periods. Such purchases would be at the broker’s discretion based on CP-established parameters prior to any blackout period. Outside of these periods, common shares would be purchased in accordance with management’s discretion, subject to applicable law.

U.S. Mountain Valley Gas Pipeline Facing More Delays | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — After a series of setbacks, the companies building the U.S. Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline now plan to seek individual permits to cross each stream remaining in its path, and analysts say that will delay its start-up until 2022.
The Mountain Valley line, a $5.8 billion-$6 billion project that stretches from West Virginia to Virginia, is one of a series of energy infrastructure projects that have been delayed by legal opposition and regulatory problems.
Equitrans Midstream Corp., the lead company building the pipeline, said in a federal filing on Tuesday that Mountain Valley would seek individual stream crossing permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, among other things. Those permits became necessary after environmental groups successfully challenged a program that allowed the crossing of a series of streams and rivers under one authorization.
EQT says the line should still be completed by the end of 2021.
“With [Mountain Valley's] total project work roughly 92 per cent complete, we believe that this prudent change in course is the most efficient regulatory path to completing the remaining components of this important natural gas infrastructure project and keeping within our current budget and schedule,” Equitrans spokeswoman Natalie Cox said.
Previously, the project relied on the Army Corps’s Nationwide Permit 12 program, which covered all stream crossings in one authorization.
Height Capital Markets analysts projected that the additional time needed to file for new permits would push Mountain Valley's in-service date into the first half of 2022.
""We expect the Biden administration will agree with environmentalists and the Fourth Circuit [Court of Appeals] panel that [Mountain Valley's] Nationwide Permit 12 authorization is flawed and require individual stream crossing permits,"" analysts at Height Capital Markets said.
When construction of Mountain Valley started in February 2018, Equitrans estimated the 487.6-kilometre pipeline would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018.
A unit of NextEra Energy Inc., one of the companies involved in the pipeline, took an impairment charge of $1.2 billion on its investment in Mountain Valley due to numerous cost overruns and delays.

White House Says Biden Believes Nord Stream 2 Pipeline Is 'Bad Deal' For Europe | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — President Joe Biden believes the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline is a ""bad deal for Europe"" and his administration will be reviewing restrictions on the project included in a bill that passed during the Trump administration, the White House said on Tuesday.
The restrictions on the undersea pipeline project were included in the annual defence policy bill that passed on Jan. 1. Sanctions in the measure apply to any companies helping Gazprom, the Russian state energy company leading the project, to lay pipeline, insure vessels or verify equipment.
The Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, opposed the project on the grounds it would strengthen Russian President Vladimir Putin's economic and political influence over Europe. Russia has cut deliveries of the fuel to Ukraine and parts of Europe in winter during pricing disputes.
Biden has also opposed the project, which would bypass Ukraine and deprive it of lucrative transit fees, since he was vice president under former President Barack Obama. Russia and Germany say the pipeline is a purely commercial project.
""We continue to believe, the president continues to believe, that Nord Stream 2 is a bad deal for Europe,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told the daily briefing, adding the administration ""will be reviewing"" the restrictions included in the defense policy legislation.
The $11 billion pipeline, which is 90 per cent complete, would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream duct to deliver gas from Russia to Europe via Germany under the Baltic Sea.
The issue is coming to a head as the Senate has begun confirming Biden cabinet members who could weigh in on decisions on the project, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and as construction resumes after being stalled for about a year following a threat of sanctions from the United States and the withdrawal of pipe-laying company Allseas.
A ship called the Fortuna on which Washington slapped sanctions on former president Donald Trump's last full day in office last Wednesday, has begun work in deep waters off Denmark, ahead of the resumption of construction, Nord Stream 2 said on Sunday.
The State Department is expected to issue a report to Congress soon on the companies helping Gazprom complete the project, which could add pressure to firms to drop out. Some companies, including Zurich Insurance Group and Norway's risk management and quality assurance firm DNV GL, have dropped work on the project.

U.S. Court Ruling Deals Another Blow To Dakota Access Oil Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– A U.S. appeals court dealt a blow to the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline on Tuesday, upholding a lower court’s decision to throw out a key federal permit for the line and order a lengthy environmental review that will determine if it can keep operating.
The decision is the latest in a series of legal and regulatory setbacks for the U.S. energy industry. In the last week, regulators denied permits to notable natural gas pipelines, while the new Biden administration effectively killed the Keystone XL pipeline project and is soon expected to limit oil and gas drilling on federal lands.
Tuesday’s court ruling raises the chances that Energy Transfer’s 557,000 bbl/d Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) will be shut pending environmental review.
Supporters of DAPL said closing the primary artery for delivering crude from North Dakota's Bakken field, could hurt output in the shale region, which produces more than one million bbls/d of oil.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruling means the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will have to conduct another environmental review that could take months. The line can remain open, however, as the appeals court disagreed with a lower court ruling that ordered the line shut.
Energy Transfer, which operates the line, was not immediately available for comment.
In July, the district court ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated federal environmental law when it permitted Energy Transfer to construct and operate a portion of DAPL that crosses Lake Oahe, a vital drinking water source for native tribes that brought the suit.
Attorneys for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has long opposed DAPL, say the Biden administration could shut the line now. The Standing Rock tribe has filed for an injunction to shut the pipeline while the environmental review is underway.
""We look forward to showing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers why this pipeline is too dangerous to operate,"" said Standing Rock Sioux Tribe chairman Mike Faith.
Shippers who use the line told Reuters on Tuesday that because the line can remain open, it is, for now, a win for Energy Transfer.
Because the appeals court upheld the rulings, the Biden administration could force the line to close, said Height Capital Markets analyst Josh Price. However, he said the administration is more likely to allow the pipeline to keep operating while the review is conducted.

Alberta Premier Wants Direct Compensation From U.S. If Keystone XL Pipeline Dead | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is making another demand of Justin Trudeau over the Keystone XL pipeline.
In a letter to Trudeau, Kenney reiterates that the prime minister must press for a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden so that Canada can make its case for the pipeline, which Biden cancelled last week on his first day in office.
Kenney also repeats that if that fails, Trudeau must take retaliatory measures such as trade sanctions.
But he also asks that Trudeau press Biden for direct compensation.
Kenney says his United Conservative government and pipeline builder TC Energy Corporation invested in the project believing it was going ahead under stable review and governance.
The premier committed $1.5 billon to the project last year, with another $6 billion in loan guarantees.
Biden made it clear last spring that he would cancel the Keystone line if he became president. He said that shipping more product from Alberta's oilsands did not mesh with his broader objective of battling climate change.
The Keystone line would have taken more Alberta oil to refineries and ports in the United States to relieve a North American bottleneck that has led to discounts and sometimes sharp reductions in the price of Alberta's oil.
In the letter dated Thursday, Kenney says the Keystone project that Biden once rejected is now a different, more environmentally friendly undertaking.
“Keystone XL will be the first pipeline of its kind to operate at net-zero emissions on its first day of operations and will purchase 100 per cent of its power load from renewable energy sources,” Kenney writes.
“I propose that we approach Washington together to begin a conversation about North American energy and climate policy.”
If that doesn't happen, he is pushing for “proportionate economic consequences.”
“At the very least, I call upon the government of Canada to press the U.S. administration to compensate TC Energy and the government of Alberta for billions of dollars of costs incurred in the construction of Keystone XL to date.
“These costs were incurred on the assumption that the United States had a predictable regulatory framework and based on the presidential permit authorizing the Keystone XL border crossing, which was installed in the summer of 2019.”
In Calgary, Opposition NDP energy critic Kathleen Ganley called again for Kenney to release details of the Keystone deal.
She said Kenney knew when he spent the money that Keystone was risky, given it was facing further legal challenges and that the Democrat contender for president at the time, Biden, had opposed it in the past.
“The path forward [for Keystone] depended on the re-election of Donald Trump,'' said Ganley.
“Premier Kenney made a $7.5-billion bet on Trump's re-election. Unfortunately for Albertans, Jason Kenney lost that bet, and now he's trying to blame everyone but himself for losing billions of Albertans' money.
“The responsibility rests squarely on his shoulders.”

Trans Mountain Pipeline Sees Fortunes Shine After KXL's Demise | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline has made the case for completing Trans Mountain’s expansion stronger.
""This pipeline is even more valuable now,"" said Joe Dion, chief executive of Western Indigenous Pipeline Group, one of several First Nations groups interested in buying Trans Mountain.
""Everybody thought Trudeau wasn't going to get things done in Canada, and he's the one who successfully got a pipeline over Trump.""
Trans Mountain takes on more strategic importance with KXL cancelled, but it does not mean his group would pay more for it, Dion said.
Trans Mountain has completed 22 per cent of the expansion project, called TMX, which is scheduled for service in December 2022. Suncor Energy Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Limited and BP plc are among the committed shippers who have secured 80 per cent of its additional capacity long-term.
""All eyes are on TMX,"" said Delbert Wapass, executive chair of Project Reconciliation, a First Nations coalition that hopes to buy 51 per cent this year.
Sharing Trans Mountain's profits would help improve living conditions on First Nations, he said.
Even without KXL, Canada may have surplus export pipeline capacity once TMX enters service, said Matt Taylor, director of infrastructure research at investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt, who expects modest oil production growth to 2025.
Ottawa plans to sell the pipeline once there are fewer risks to completion and consultations wrap up with First Nations, said Finance Ministry spokeswoman Katherine Cuplinskas. TMX has faced stiff opposition over spill concerns.
A second government source said it bought Trans Mountain for its strategic importance, as its Pacific Ocean connection enables shippers to move oil to Asia, as well as the United States, which buys most Canadian crude.
Now its importance is even greater, the source said.
Enbridge Inc. also stands to gain from KXL's demise. It intends to sell long-term contracts for most of the Mainline's capacity, pending regulator approval, rather than continue to ration it on the spot market.
KXL's cancellation frees up long-term commitments by shippers who may now sign Mainline contracts, Taylor said.

"Cancelled Keystone XL Pipeline May Yield 48,000 Tonnes of Scrap | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) –– The scrapping of Keystone XL not only means the end of multibillion-dollar pipe dream for TC Energy Corporation –– it also leaves behind 48,000 tonnes of steel.
U.S. President Joe Biden revoked permits for the oil pipeline on his first day in office, killing a cross-border project that had won a four-year reprieve under his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
About 150 kilometres of pipe had been installed and an additional 2.2 kilometres had been completed at the Canada-U.S. border as of the end of 2020, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) said in a Jan. 22 email. That would amount to nearly 48,000 tonnes of steel, assuming standard dimensions of line pipe, according to Bloomberg calculations based on industry criteria.
The benchmark steel price is about $1,060 a ton, which would value the haul at almost $51 million –– though as scrap it would be sold for less. Secondary metal, which is any scrap that is already past use for its original purpose, sells at a discount to new forms of the raw material. Once sold, the scrap metal is remelted by the buyer and formed into new steel products.
TC Energy may to have to sell already delivered metal to secondary markets. While unclear exactly how much steel the Calgary-based firm owns that’s tied to Keystone –– some may also be in storage –– industry observers say it likely isn’t enough to make a dent on the market. The amount that could be sold would be a fraction of the total U.S. steel market demand of around 100 million tonnes a year.
TC Energy couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for the Canada Energy Regulator said no decisions have been made on the steel.
The regulator “continues to engage with TC Energy since the presidential permit for the Keystone XL Project was revoked,” the Canadian agency said in the statement, adding that it will “continue its regulatory oversight, focusing on ensuring safety and environmental protection.”

CER Continuing To Regulate Keystone XL In Canada | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
While United States President Joe Biden has revoked the presidential permit for Keystone XL, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) will continue its regulatory oversight on the Canadian segment, focusing on ensuring safety and environmental protection.
In March 2010, the National Energy Board (NEB) approved the Canadian portion which includes 529 kilometres of pipeline from Hardisty to the Canada/U.S. border at Monchy, Saskatchewan.
Owner TC Energy Corporation’s construction activities in Canada have occurred primarily within Alberta, with the exception of the completed 2.2-kilometre section at the Canada/U.S. border crossing. As of the end of the 2020, this includes about 190 kilometres of right-of-way physically affected by construction activities and about 150 kilometres of installed pipeline.

"Even Without Keystone XL, U.S. Set For Record Canadian Oil Imports | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– The Keystone XL pipeline project may be dead, but the United States is still poised to pull in record imports of Canadian oil in coming years through other pipelines that are in the midst of expanding.
Currently, Canada exports about 3.8 million bbls/d to the United States, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Analysts expect that to rise to between 4.2 million and 4.4 million bbls/d over the next few years.
Pipeline expansions currently in progress will add more than 950,000 bbls/d of export capacity for Canadian producers before 2025, according to Rystad Energy.
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) says there is enough capacity currently to export more than four million bbls/d to the United States.
Biden's administration has set a goal of moving towards decarbonization and reducing the country's reliance on oil and gas and cutting harmful air pollutants. Most of the nation's energy still comes from fossil fuels.
""Whatever limited benefit that Keystone was projected to provide now has to be obviously reconsidered with the economy of today,"" said Gina McCarthy, Biden's leading domestic climate policy coordinator at the White House.
Even without Keystone, however, the United States now relies on Canada for more than half of its imported oil. Several of the lines carrying that crude are in the midst of expansions.
""We will be over-piped assuming the other pipelines go ahead on schedule,"" said Wood Mackenzie Ltd. research director Mark Oberstoetter. ""If you add them all up, you can make the argument KXL was not needed.""
Construction underway on Trans Mountain and Line 3 could still be held up by environmental protests, but unlike Keystone XL, both pipelines have cleared legal and regulatory hurdles.
Oil production in Western Canada will rise in 2021 to a new record of 4.45 million bbls/d, RBN Energy estimates, up from 3.9 million bbls/d in 2020, most of which will be exported to the United States.
""While the politics around KXL will continue to reverberate for some time, the reality is that Western Canada –– for the first time in recent memory –– may soon reach a juncture at which it has excess oil export capacity,"" Thomas Liles, Rystad Energy’s vice president for North American shale, said in a note.

U.S. Government Approves Routes For Wyoming CO2 Pipelines | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– The U.S. government has approved routes for a system of pipelines that would move carbon dioxide across Wyoming in what could be by far the largest such network in North America, if it is developed.
The greenhouse gas would be captured from coal-fired power plants, keeping it out of the atmosphere where it causes global warming. The captured gas would instead be pumped underground to add pressure to and boost production from oil fields.
In all, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management designated 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometres) of federal land for pipeline development through the Wyoming Pipeline Corridor Initiative, the Casper Star-Tribune reported.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed the plans last Friday, days before leaving office with the rest of former President Donald Trump's administration. The approval allows companies to begin submitting pipeline construction proposals.
Wyoming officials including Republican Gov. Mark Gordon have promoted carbon capture as a way to boost the state's struggling coal mining industry.

"Brookfield, KKR Said To Eye $10 Billion Aramco Pipeline Stake | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) –– Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and KKR & Co. are among top infrastructure investors weighing bids for a stake in Saudi Aramco’s oil pipelines, people familiar with the matter said.
Apollo Global Management Inc. has also been studying whether to make an offer, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The stake sale could fetch Aramco around $10 billion, the people said.
The world’s top oil producer has asked for expressions of interest and aims to receive non-binding offers next month, according to the people. The sale could also draw interest from Chinese investment funds, the people said. Some bidders may team up given the size of the transaction, the people said.
Aramco has been seeking to raise funds by selling stakes in non-core assets, mirroring a strategy adopted by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. An investor group including Brookfield and GIC Pte invested $10.1 billion in Adnoc’s natural-gas pipelines last year.
While large Canadian pension funds often pursue such assets, some may shy away from the Aramco deal given political tensions between their government and Saudi Arabia, according to the people. Deliberations are at an early stage, and details of the potential transaction could change, the people said.
Representatives for Apollo, Aramco, Brookfield and KKR declined to comment.
Aramco is lining up a loan of about $7.5 billion that will be offered to potential investors in the oil pipelines, people familiar with the matter said last week. The oil producer is seeking new sources of capital to maintain annual dividend payments of $75 billion at a time of lower crude prices. Most of those payouts go to the Saudi state, which needs the money to fund its budget.

"Keystone XL Decision Demands Strong Action From Ottawa, Says Kenney | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau must be ready to impose meaningful trade and economic sanctions against the United States if the new Biden administration is not prepared to review Wednesday’s decision to revoke the presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, says Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.
“Surely, hundreds of thousands of energy workers deserve at least as strong a defense from their national government, as that government gave to Canadian steel workers in central Canada and elsewhere,” he told reporters following the announcement that President Joe Biden had signed the executive order cancelling the permit issued by former president Donald Trump.
Alberta wants the Canadian federal government to take the issue as seriously as it would take the defense of the Canadian auto sector or the aviation sector, said the Alberta premier.
Kenney called on Trudeau and his government to ask the new U.S. administration to “seek to enter into a respectful dialogue about energy and the environment and how this safe job-creating project [Keystone XL] can operate in that context.” 
Failing that, the government needs to “demonstrate that Canada will stand up for itself against this uncalled for attack against our country's vital economic interests,” he said. Biden is scheduled to talk to Trudeau Friday, according to a spokesperson for the president.
 “When you're dealing with a trading partner, who attacks your vital interest . . . and thereby imposing very real financial, economic and damage on our country and our province, then a response is called for because otherwise it invites similar decisions in the future,” said Kenney. “That is exactly the principle which guided the Trudeau government, quite rightly, to impose countervailing tariffs on U.S. products, following the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada.”
The U.S. later withdrew its tariffs and Canada in response did the same.  
Kenney said he believes the Trudeau government’s failure to “respond with strength” to former president Barack Obama’s earlier refusal to issue a presidential permit for the TC Energy Corporation project led in part to the current impasse. “I believe that the transition team, the new administration, concluded from the lack of a meaningful response to the 2015 veto, that this federal government doesn't really intend to stand up for this country's largest industry.”  
“I hope that's not true,” he added. “I appreciate Prime Minister Trudeau’s recent words, expressions of support for this project but that support is only meaningful if it is followed by action,” which defends Canadian workers in the country’s largest export industry, the energy industry.
“I appreciate the words but now we need to see actions,” said Kenney. “And obviously, if we don't see those actions, if we don't see the same seriousness about this issue that we did on aluminum and steel tariffs and other sectors attacked by American protectionism, then that will only impel us to force us to go further in our fight for a fair deal in the federation.”
The Alberta premier also warned that a failure of the federal government to respond in a meaningful and direct way to Biden’s executive order on Keystone XL would create a dangerous precedent for similar actions in the future.
“The largest element of our trading relationship is this energy and the same political forces that today succeeded in obtaining this retroactive veto are seeking now to kill other critical pipelines that safely deliver Canadian energy to fuel the U.S.  economy,” he said. Those efforts include recent efforts by the governor and attorney general of Michigan to decommission Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5 project which has safely operated for 60 years, said Kenney.
“If they succeed in doing so, or if they persuade this administration to apply this precedent of retroactively rescinding presidential permits for pipeline border crossings, that would have a devastating impact not only on the energy workers of Western Canada, but on the manufacturing workers and just ordinary families in southern Ontario, who depend on that as their main source of energy,” he said.
In a statement Wednesday, Trudeau said he was “disappointed” with Biden’s decision which had been a campaign promise while Kirsten Hillman, Canadian ambassador to the U.S., said Canada should “accept it and move forward. ”
However, Trump also campaigned on imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports to the U.S., noted Kenney. “The position of the Trudeau government wasn't to accept that and move forward,” he said. “It was not to understand that position on tariffs and to respect the decision, as they've said today, it was to fight it.”
Kenney questioned why the Trudeau government was prepared take action when “at most a few billion dollars” of aluminum and steel exports to the United States were at stake but to take no similar measure to defend a  $90 billion energy export industry which is twice the size of the auto trade between Canada and the U.S. “Just because a foreign government gets elected on a promise to hurt our economic interests, does not mean we can or should accept the damage inflicted by foreign government policies.”  
The Canadian federal government has “quite close alignment” with the new U.S. administration on many aspects of environmental and climate policy and has said it hopes to have a meaningful dialogue with it on those topics, he said. “Within the context of those discussions, energy infrastructure — including Keystone XL — must be part of that discussion.”
Kenney, whose government invested $1.5 billion in Keystone XL to enable construction to begin last year, said he has talked to TC Energy about the next steps. “None of us are going to rush into making any improvised decisions here,” he said. “We're going to take our time [and] do close legal analysis of the actual wording of the executive order signed by the president today.”
The company announced Wednesday that it is suspending work on the project indefinitely and that will reduce any potential liability that the Alberta government might incur for construction in this quarter, said Kenney.
“If ultimately damages are incurred, we will use every legal means at our disposal to seek … compensation and to seek legal remedies for those damages,” he said, noting that the Alberta government has already obtained at least two legal opinions in that respect. “And we do believe that Alberta would have a strong case to make.”
However, if the federal government declines to take action against the U.S. and the partners determine there is no legal avenue to proceed with construction effectively under the permit, they may have to decide to abandon the project, the government in the interest of Alberta taxpayers and TC energy in the interest of its shareholders, he said.
“If that happens, then there would be liquidation of assets,” said Kenney who earlier had suggested that might enable the government to recoup some of its losses.

Union Disappointed With Biden Decision To Revoke Keystone XL Permit | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A union whose member companies build major infrastructure projects and employ thousands of Alberta and B.C. construction workers, says U.S. President Joe Biden has “put politics before reason” in his decision to Wednesday to rescind the Keystone XL pipeline permit.
 “We’re disappointed that the new president has lost sight of the huge economic and strategic advantages of this project,” said Paul de Jong, president of the Progressive Contractors Association of Canada (PCA), said in a statement. “It’s yet another signal to natural resource energy providers that governments don’t have the gumption to stand up for projects, even when they meet every condition.”
After undergoing an extensive regulatory review, Keystone XL met all requirements and had the support of a broad range of stakeholders from the federal, Alberta, and Saskatchewan governments to an alliance of First Nations, he said. Built to safe, modern standards, the pipeline also is committed to achieving net-zero emissions.
 “Pulling the plug on a major project, hours after taking office, is a rocky starting point for re-setting Canada/U.S. relations,” said de Jong. “It’s a sorry day when logic goes out the window, along with thousands of jobs and billions in revenue from a stable energy source that would have served the national interests of both countries.”

"TC Energy To Cut 1,000 Construction Jobs, Halt Keystone XL Work | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– TC Energy Corporation will eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs in coming weeks and halt work on the Keystone XL oil pipeline after U.S. President Joe Biden revoked the project's presidential permit, the company said in an email to employees.
TC Energy confirmed the authenticity of the email, sent by KXL president Richard Prior on Wednesday and seen by Reuters.
Biden's decision to cancel the permit is likely to be the project's death knell, after more than a decade of legal battles and shifting fortunes based on who held office in the White House. Opponents of the line fought its construction for years, saying it was unnecessary and would hamper the U.S. transition to cleaner fuels.
Proponents of the line argued that it created several thousand good-paying jobs and that pipelines remain the safest ways to transport fuel, but many analysts thought the chances of its completion were slim.
""KXL never quite escaped the shadow of uncertainty in the eyes of many producers,"" said Thomas Liles, vice-president for North American shale at Rystad Energy, in an email.
Prior, in his email, said they will start to shut down construction at U.S. pump station sites and the Canadian portion of the project in coming weeks.
""I believe this will send a concerning signal to infrastructure developers that resonates far beyond our project and will stifle innovation for a practical transition towards sustainable energy,"" he said in the letter.

AER Approves Connacher Great Divide Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Connacher Oil and Gas Limited says it has received Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) approval for a sales oil pipeline lateral from its Great Divide SAGD project in the Athabasca oilsands.
The 26.5 kilometre, 10-inch diameter pipeline will have an initial capacity of 18,000 bbls/d. It is expected to be completed by the second half of 2022 and will provide efficient access to a liquid market hub for the sale of its product, said the company. While the in-service date is dependent on financing efforts, the pipeline will reduce transportation costs and increase market access, it said.
In addition to enhanced access for blended bitumen, Connacher is pursuing alternatives to improve access and reduce costs of diluent.
In 2020, the company undertook two new initiatives and continued a third to improve profitability, enhance its competitiveness and position it for the future.
In the second quarter, Connacher approached the AER and Alberta Boilers Safety Association to secure approvals to streamline its operations at its Pod One and Algar thermal projects. Although the facilities are only seven kilometres apart, they have always been operated as separate entities. Under the One Connacher project, wherever safely possible, duplication has been eliminated with the most recent step in November 2020 with the combination of the two control rooms. The efficiencies gained from the project are expected to reduce operating costs, as well as increase consistency across its operations, said Connacher.
In the third quarter of 2020, Connacher took advantage of favourable market conditions and drilled four infill wells at Algar, each several metres below the current producing wells to access previously bypassed pay. The additional production the wells will reduce its steam oil ratios, reduce operating costs per bbl, increase proven reserves and lower its GHG emissions intensity.
Earlier in the year, following the drop in crude oil prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Connacher significantly reduced production from its Great Divide operations in order to preserve cash. As prices began to recover, production was safely ramped back up to pre-COVID levels towards the end of the second quarter of 2020.
Connacher entered 2020 with production of just over 12,000 bbls/d. With the decline in crude oil prices in March, it decided to significantly reduce production until crude oil prices recovered. Production reached a low of 1,350 bbls/d in April and then began to ramp back up through May and June, returning 12,000 bbls/d in July. Current production levels are approximately 13,000 bbls/d, recognizing the partial benefit of the four new infill wells that were completed in the third quarter of 2020 and currently being brought onstream.
Although EBITDA in the first half of 2020 was negatively affected by low crude oil prices and reduced production, it recovered to $13.5 million in the second half of 2020 through a combination of recovering crude oil prices and production, and various improvements in costs and efficiencies. This was in line with the second half 2019 EBITDA of $14.1 million during which time crude oil prices, specifically WCS in Canadian dollars, were approximately 30 per cent higher, Connacher said.
As a result of its initiatives, the company ended 2020 with a relatively strong balance sheet. At Dec. 31, 2020, it had $48.7 million of long-term debt, offset by $52.1 million in cash and non-cash working capital while taking into account the development capital spent on drilling the four infill wells.

Biden Revokes KXL Permit | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday formally revoked the permit needed to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline (KXL), dashing hopes of salvaging the project that the struggling Canadian crude sector has long supported.
The move represents another set-back for the beleaguered Canadian energy industry, kills thousands of jobs and marks an early bump in Biden’s relationship with Canada, a key trading partner. Biden had long promised to scrap the permit.
Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to Washington, told CTV that Ottawa was “very disappointed.” Foreign Minister Marc Garneau, speaking minutes earlier, took a more muted tone, telling CTV that Canada respected and understood the decision.
Keystone XL, owned by TC Energy Corporation, would have carried 830,000 bbls/d of Alberta oilsands crude to Nebraska. Opposition from U.S. landowners, Native American tribes and environmentalists has delayed the project for the past 12 years.
Former President Donald Trump revived the project, but it still faced ongoing legal challenges.
TC Energy, in a statement issued before the revocation, expressed disappointment with a move it said would overturn a regulatory process that had lasted more than a decade.
The company said it will suspend construction and warned there could be a “substantive” predominantly non-cash, after-tax charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2021. TC Energy said the decision would lead to layoffs for thousands of unionized construction workers.

"Keystone XL Pipeline To Be Suspended If Presidential Permit Revoked, Says TC Energy | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
TC Energy Corporation says it will suspend advancement of the Keystone XL pipeline as a result of today’s expected decision by incoming president Joe Biden to revoke its presidential permit.  
In a statement, the company said it would cease capitalizing costs, including interest during construction, effective today if the permit is revoked, and will evaluate the carrying value of its investment in the pipeline, net of project recoveries. “Absent intervening actions, these steps could result in a substantative, predominantly non-cash after-tax charge to earnings in first quarter 2021,” it said.
TC Energy said it would review the decision, assess its implications, and consider its options. It also plans to modify its previously announced financing plans as it would no longer expect to issue hybrid securities or common shares under its dividend reinvestment plan to partially fund the project.
The company said it is disappointed with the expected action to revoke the existing permit for Keystone XL which it said would overturn an unprecedented, comprehensive regulatory process that lasted more than a decade and repeatedly concluded the pipeline would transport much needed energy in an environmentally responsible way while enhancing North American energy security. “The action would directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers and negatively impact ground-breaking industry commitments to use new renewable energy as well as historic equity partnerships with Indigenous communities,” it added.
In the meantime, TC Energy’s base business continues to perform very well and, aside from Keystone XL, is advancing $25 billion of secured capital projects along with a portfolio of other similarly high quality opportunities under development, said François Poirier, president and chief executive officer. “These initiatives are expected to generate growth in earnings and cash flow per share and support annual dividend increases of eight to 10 per cent in 2021 and five to seven per cent thereafter.”

"Biden Set To Rejoin Paris Climate Accord, Impose Curbs On U.S. Oil Industry | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– Incoming U.S. president Joe Biden will announce America’s return to the international Paris Agreement to fight climate change on Wednesday, the centerpiece of a raft of day-one executive orders aimed at restoring U.S. leadership in combating global warming.
The announcements will also include a sweeping order to review all of ex-President Donald Trump's actions weakening climate change protections, the revocation of a vital permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline project from Canada, and a moratorium on oil and gas leasing activities in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge that Trump's administration had recently opened to development, Biden aides said.
The orders will mark the start of a major policy reversal in the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China, after four years during which Trump’s administration pilloried climate science and rolled back environmental regulation to maximize fossil fuel development.
Biden has promised to put the United States on a track to net-zero emissions by 2050 to match the steep and swift global cuts that scientists say are needed to avoid the most devastating impacts of global warming, using curbs on fossil fuels and massive investments in clean energy.
The path won't be easy, though, with political divisions in the United States, opposition from fossil fuel companies, and wary international partners concerned about U.S. policy shifts obstructing the way.
""We got off track very severely for the last four years with a climate denier in the Oval Office,"" said John Podesta, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who helped craft the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""We enter the international arena with a credibility deficit.""
Biden's orders will also require government agencies to consider revising vehicle fuel efficiency standards and methane emissions curbs, and to study the possibility of re-expanding the boundaries of wilderness national monuments that had been reduced in size by the Trump administration.
Hard part ahead
Global counterparts and climate advocates welcomed Washington’s return to cooperation on climate change, but expressed some skepticism about its staying power, and its ability to overcome domestic political turmoil to enact ambitious new regulation.
Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Paris deal late last year, arguing it was too costly to the U.S. economy and would provide little tangible benefit, and swept away scores of environmental protections he saw as onerous to drillers, miners, and manufacturers.
""The United States continues to be the one and only country that has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, making it, frankly, the pariah of this multilateral agreement,"" former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, told Reuters.
Biden can regain U.S. credibility by “doing the domestic homework” of ambitious climate action at home.
Brian Deese, Biden’s incoming director of the National Economic Council, told Reuters that the United States hopes to encourage other big emitters to also ""push their ambition, even as we have to demonstrate our ability to come back on the stage and show leadership.""
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, said China, the world's top carbon emitter, ""looks forward"" to the return of the United States to the Paris pact.
The climate envoy from the low-lying Marshall Islands, meanwhile, suggested the United States could help press for stronger climate commitments around the globe.
“The world is looking to the Biden-Harris administration to generate solutions to the climate crisis, reinvigorate commitment to the Paris Agreement, and ensure that countries around the world can deliver a green and resilient recovery from COVID-19,"" Tina Eonemto Stege said.
Pete Betts, an associate fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House who led climate negotiations for the European Union when the Paris deal was struck, said the United States will need to match its promises with financial commitments too.
The United States under Obama pledged to deliver $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help vulnerable countries fight climate change. It has delivered only $1 billion so far.
“The U.S. will need to put some money on the table, and also encourage others to do the same,” he said.
Biden has tapped former Secretary of State John Kerry as his international climate envoy and is expected to set up a meeting in the coming weeks with global counterparts.

"Biden Takes Sweeping Day One Action On Energy, Climate, Immigration | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday began signing 15 executive actions addressing the coronavirus pandemic, climate change and racial inequality, and undoing some policies put in place by his predecessor Donald Trump.
The actions, fulfilling his promise to move quickly on Day One of his presidency, initiate the process of the United States rejoining the Paris climate accord and include the revocation of the presidential permit granted for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline.
The steps Biden is taking will end a travel ban Trump put in place on some majority-Muslim countries. He is also calling upon his administration to strengthen the DACA program for immigrants brought to the United States as children.
The new president is also ordering the wearing of masks and social distancing in all federal buildings and on all federal lands and is ending a national emergency declaration that was the basis for diverting some federal funds to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Lauerman: Moving On Quickly Could Cut Alberta’s Losses On Keystone XL Bet | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Joe Biden will be cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline expansion (KXL) as one of his first acts after being inaugurated president of the U.S., based on news reports over the weekend, costing Alberta taxpayers at least part of the UCP government’s $1.5-billion equity investment in the project, and possibly much more.
On a related note, at a news conference held on Monday afternoon, Premier Jason Kenney said the Alberta government had already retained legal counsel to guide a lawsuit against the U.S. government if Biden does in fact put an end to KXL.
Depending how much the KXL fiasco ultimately costs Alberta, with at least part of the $6 billion loan guarantee also at risk — the guarantee went into effect on Jan. 4, and may cover sunk costs such as pre-bought pipe as well — the UCP government’s massive gamble could go down as the largest financial blunder in the province’s history.
What makes this all the more painful, the writing was on the wall for an anti-KXL candidate from the Democratic Party winning November’s presidential election when Premier Kenney announced the province’s financial backing of the project at the end of March, while even then the ‘need’ for the project was questionable at the time.
 Fortunately — and that’s a tough way to frame it — there are a few potential bright spots for Alberta, especially if soon-to-be President Biden does in fact kill KXL on the afternoon of Jan. 20, rather than later on.
Kenney’s rationales 
When Kenney announced Alberta’s investment in KXL at the end of March 2020 to kick-start construction, the result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election was already hanging over the ultimate fate of the project. And hence, TC Energy’s unwillingness to go ahead with the project at the time without the province taking on most of the risk.
The reasons Premier Kenney has given for the Alberta government taking a $1.5-billion equity stake in KXL and providing the project with a $6 billion loan guarantee include: to create jobs, with coronavirus hitting the global and provincial economies hard at the end of March; the need for its pipeline capacity to move western Canadian crude to market; and in May, to create ‘facts on the ground’ once the Biden campaign said the Democratic nominee would kill KXL if elected president.
It was very Keynesian of our conservative premier to promote job creation in the face of another global depression. But Kenney could have created more jobs if he had spent the money on provincial infrastructure projects, rather than a pipeline with the bulk of the work in the U.S. Or if he simply had Albertans dig holes and fill them back up again, as suggested by John Maynard Keynes to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s. Heck, that’s exactly what Kenney just had TC Energy do on our behalf, but unfortunately not all of the holes were in Alberta.
Also, Premier Kenney appears to have confused a ‘need’ with a ‘want’ when defending his government’s investment in KXL. There is no doubt sophisticated refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region are an ideal market for our heavy oil, and the bullet line provided by the KXL project — including the previously constructed southern U.S. section — would provide relatively high netbacks to our producers.
But as I argued in Biden Presidency Series Part 4 – Impact On Canadian Oil And Gas this past summer, with both Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement and the federal government-owned TMX likely to come online in 2022, no KXL capacity would be needed before 2030. And that was based on CAPP’s extremely optimistic June 2019 outlook for western Canadian crude oil production — no outlook was released in 2020, purportedly because of uncertainties caused by the pandemic.
And since then, the world appears to have finally gotten serious about combatting climate change, with numerous major companies and countries committing to net-zero emission targets. This puts into question whether KXL’s capacity would ever be needed.
Finally, Kenney’s ‘facts on the ground’ argument has been widely negated by many, including me in Premier Kenney’s Risky Gamble On Keystone XL.
Bad bet
Any student of politics, such as Premier Kenney, should have known last March when he announced the province’s investment in KXL that it was an extremely risky gamble for two reasons: COVID-related economic carnage threatening President Donald Trump’s re-election hopes; and the two remaining Democratic nominees being diametrically opposed to the project.
As the famous U.S. election strategist James Carville said in 1992 when working for Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president at the time, “It’s the economy, stupid.” As a rule, U.S. presidential elections are won and lost based on the strength of the domestic economy. Since Kenney telegraphed his concern about the global and provincial economies at the end of March when using jobs as a reason for Alberta investing in KXL, he should have known President Trump was in serious risk of losing the November election.
In terms of the two Democratic presidential nominees still standing at the end of March, former Vice President Joe Biden wholeheartedly supported the Obama administration’s decision to refuse KXL a presidential permit in 2015 — subsequently reversed by Trump in 2017. And Bernie Sanders, the progressive firebrand of the Democratic Party, upon learning of Biden’s decision to kill KXL as one of his first acts as president, tweeted the following on Jan. 17: “The Keystone pipeline is & always has been a disaster. I'm delighted that Joe Biden will cancel the Keystone permit on his first day in office. With all of the major crises facing America, we must never lose sight of the most existential threat facing our planet: climate change.”
Silver linings
The potential bright spots, besides possibly never needing KXL’s crude capacity, include: the sooner the project is killed, the less Alberta taxpayers will lose; the possibility of winning back some of our losses through a lawsuit against the U.S. government; and the Biden administration more likely siding with Enbridge Inc. than the Michigan government over the Line 5 shutdown order, if for no other reason than to placate Canada, a good friend and ally, after the very political KXL decision — especially if we take our KXL lumps in relatively good spirit.
A delayed cancellation of the project would be the worst possible outcome for Alberta. Not only would we have no KXL pipeline accessing the lucrative U.S. Gulf Coast market, but the province would be on the hook for both the $1.5 billion equity stake in the pipeline and a more significant chunk of the $6 billion loan guarantee as well.
The Alberta government and TC Energy may or may not have a legal case against the U.S. government, depending which legal scholar one talks to, and hence may or may not be able to recoup investment losses when President Biden kills KXL. According to James Coleman, an energy law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, the probability of a successful lawsuit is less than 50 per cent.
To conclude, it would be greatly appreciated if Premier Kenney and his UCP government were much more careful ‘investing’ Alberta’s money in the future than it was when backstopping the ill-fated KXL project.

"Canada Is Pressing Biden Administration On Keystone XL Pipeline, Trudeau Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– Canada is pressing people at the highest levels of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration to reconsider canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.
“We've had a clear and consistent position supporting this project for years,"" Trudeau told reporters. ""Our government is making sure that Canada's views are heard and considered by the incoming administration at the highest levels.""
They are Trudeau's first comments since Reuters reported on Sunday that Biden would scrap the $8 billion pipeline permit as one of his first acts in office over concerns about fossil fuels contributing to climate change.
Scuttling the project would threaten Canadian jobs and undermine the U.S.-Canadian relationship as Trudeau tries to turn the page on the Donald Trump era, but it was one of Biden's campaign promises.
“We understand of course that it is a commitment the candidate Joe Biden made to cancel this pipeline,"" Trudeau said, adding he aimed to speak to the new president in ""coming days"" about Keystone XL and other issues.
""I have confidence that we will be heard and that our arguments will be considered in this process,"" Trudeau said, adding he was underscoring the need for energy security and the potential jobs at stake.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney threatened legal action on Monday if the project is scrapped. Trudeau declined to comment on whether he would support legal action, but said he planned to speak with Kenney later on Tuesday.

Trudeau Needs To Intervene To Prevent Potential Keystone XL Cancellation: Kenney | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Premier Jason Kenney is calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to immediately contact the incoming administration of the United States to reiterate that TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL pipeline is at the top of the agenda for bilateral relations. 
“The United States government owes Canada the respect to at least sit down with us and talk about this vital project in the broader context of our shared challenge in addressing climate change, continental energy security and broader issues,” Kenney told reporters today in response to reports that incoming president Joe Biden plans to cancel the presidential permit for the project in his first day in office. “Surely, the relationship between Canada and the United States is worth at least having that discussion.”
In the United States, the large construction unions that supported the Biden campaign also are reaching out “in a very blunt way” right now to the transition team to remind it that it committed to respect the unions and to at least listen to them on any decisions that could affect union jobs, he said.
Alberta is deeply concerned about the potential cancellation in part because that if a presidential order is signed, abrogating the border-crossing permit, it would affect a pipeline that already crosses the border, said Kenney. “If a precedent is created, where the United States government can unilaterally stop border crossings of pipelines that … often already exist, then this could be applied to the many other pipelines that provide Canadian energy,” he suggested.
“We need to see Keystone XL in the context of a broader effort to block Canada's largest export product to the United States,” including Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5 and Line 3 replacement, said Kenney. “That represents $100 billion of value a year for the Canadian economy.”
“So this is about more than just Keystone XL, this is about the Canada-U.S. relationship,” he said. “This is about tens of thousands of jobs here. This is about billions of dollars of revenue for governments to pay for things like health care.”
Should the project be cancelled, the Alberta government, which made a $1.5 billion equity investment, will be out about $1 billion, according to Kenney.
The Alberta government has retained legal counsel both in Canada and the U.S. to advise it through the entire process.
Kenney said his government is not interested in purchasing the pipeline as the Canadian government did in the case of Trans Mountain. “We made what I believe was a prudent investment to move the project forward … and that limits exposure to taxpayers,” he said. “And if we need to pursue legal action to defend our interests, we will do so.”
TC Energy also has announced a new sustainable energy initiative for the project that would achieve net zero emissions across the project operations when it is placed into service in 2023. The company also has committed the operations will be fully powered by renewable energy sources no later than 2030.
This announcement comes after an extensive period of study and analysis, and as part of the company’s ongoing commitment to sustainability, thoughtfully finding innovative ways to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while providing communities with reliable energy today.
As part of the announcement, TC Energy is expected to spur an investment of more than US$1.7 billion in communities along the Keystone XL footprint creating approximately 1.6 gigawatts of renewable electric capacity, and thousands of construction jobs in rural and Indigenous communities.
Keystone XL also has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) to work together on the construction of TC Energy owned or sourced renewable energy projects as part of its continued commitment to working with union labour in the U.S. and Canada.

Biden May Cancel Keystone XL Pipeline Permit On First Day In Office: Report | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 U.S. president-elect Joe Biden is planning to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit via executive action on his first day in office, CBC News reported on Sunday, citing sources.
A briefing note from the Biden transition team was widely circulated over the weekend after being shared by the incoming president's team with U.S. stakeholders, the Canadian broadcaster reported.
The words ""Rescind Keystone XL pipeline permit"" appeared on a list of executive actions likely scheduled for the first day of Biden's presidency, according to the report.
Biden's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
Keystone XL was seen to face a potential fatal blow when Biden takes office on Wednesday if he followed through on a vow to scrap the oil pipeline's presidential permit.
Former Democratic President Barack Obama axed the project in 2015, saying Canada would reap most of the economic benefits, while the project would add to greenhouse gas emissions.
Outgoing Republican President Donald Trump issued a presidential permit in 2017 that allowed the line to move forward, and several environmental groups sued the U.S. government.
In a prepared statement, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said he was “deeply concerned” by  reports that the incoming Biden administration may repeal the Presidential permit for the Keystone XL border crossing next week.
 “Doing so would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important Canada-U.S. relationship, and undermine U.S. national security by making the United States more dependent on OPEC oil imports in the future,” the premier said.
 “In 2019, the United States imported 9.14 million barrels per day of petroleum, 3.7 million of which came from Canada. The rest comes from countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, none of whom share the commitment of Canada and the United States to environmental stewardship, combatting climate change, or North American energy security.
 “As president-elect Biden’s green jobs plan acknowledges, Americans will consume millions of barrels of oil per day for years to come. It is in perfect keeping with his plan that the United States energy needs should be met by a country that takes the challenges of climate change seriously.
 “The Keystone XL pipeline also represents tens of thousands of good-paying jobs that the American economy needs right now. That is why major American labour unions who supported resident-elect Biden’s campaign strongly back the project, as do First Nations who have signed partnership agreements, and all state governments along the pipeline route.”
Kenney added:  “As the Government of Canada has said, building Keystone XL is ‘top of the agenda’ with the incoming Biden administration. Prime Minister Trudeau raised the issue with president-elect Biden on their November 9, 2020, telephone meeting, agreeing 'to engage on key issues, including … energy co-operation such as Keystone XL.'
“We renew our call on the incoming administration to show respect for Canada as the United States’ most important trading partner and strategic ally by keeping that commitment to engage, and to allow Canada to make the case for strengthening co-operation on energy, the environment, and the economy through this project.
“Should the incoming U.S. administration abrogate the Keystone-XL permit, Alberta will work with [TC Energy Corporation] to use all legal avenues available to protect its interest in the project.”
TC Energy said it would achieve net zero emissions by 2023 when it enters service. The company also pledged to use only renewable energy sources by 2030 in a bid to win Biden's support.

"Baker Hughes, AXA Group, 16 Others Quit Nord Stream 2 Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– Baker Hughes and AXA Group and 16 other companies recently quit work on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and will not be sanctioned, according to a document the Biden administration sent to Congress last week which was seen by Reuters.
Russian energy company Gazprom and its western partners are racing to build the pipeline to take Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, and hope to finish it this year. President Joe Biden believes the pipeline is a “bad deal” for Europe.
Many U.S. lawmakers and officials say the pipeline would increase Russia’s political and economic leverage over Europe. The $11 billion pipeline, which would double the capacity of its existing duct, would bypass Ukraine through which Russia has sent gas to Europe for decades. That could deprive Ukraine and other Eastern European countries of lucrative transit fees and potentially undermine its struggle against Russian aggression.
The United States, the world's top gas producer, also would like to export liquefied natural gas to Europe as an alternative to Russian gas.
The U.S. State Department told Congress on Friday it had designated the Russian ship Fortuna and its owner, KVT-RUS, for helping to build Nord Stream 2 under sanctions law that took effect this year. But the two had already been sanctioned by the Trump administration under previous law, and opponents of the project in Congress said sanctioning them again would not stop the pipeline.
Last week U.S. representatives listed 15 ships that are ""possibly engaged"" in laying pipelines or related activities since Jan. 1 when the latest U.S. sanctions became law, including the Russia flagged vessels, the Ivan Sidorenko, and the Murman.
Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, told reporters this week the fact that the companies quit with sanctions looming “demonstrates that the legislative goals and our actions are having a good effect.”
He said the State Department continues to ""examine entities involved in potentially sanctionable activity."" Price has also said ""sanctions are only one"" of many tools in response to Nord Stream 2.
Baker Hughes and insurance companies Tokio Marine Kiln Syndicates Ltd and Aspen Managing Agency Ltd, had no comment. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A few of them, including Norway's verification company DNV GL, and insurers Zurich Insurance, Munich Re, had already said they dropped out after U.S. pressure.
German engineering group Bilfinger said in January it had withdrawn from work on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, on concerns about looming U.S. sanctions.

"BP Midstream Pipeline Volumes Rise In 4th Quarter, Down For 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– BP Midstream Partners LP shipped about five per cent more oil on its pipelines in the last three months of 2020 than in the previous quarter, but overall volumes fell on the year due to fuel demand destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic, company executives said on Thursday.
Volumes of crude oil from offshore pipeline systems, including the 400,000 bbl/d Mars crude oil pipeline off the Louisiana coast, jumped 11 per cent in the three months ended on Dec. 31 compared with the previous three months and inland pipelines were up four per cent.
Still, oil volumes for all of 2020 slipped as travel restrictions sparked by the global COVID-19 health crisis slashed energy demand and hurricanes Delta and Zeta shut in offshore oil production last fall.
“Even with the impacts of COVID-19 and multiple weather events in the Gulf of Mexico during a historic Atlantic hurricane season, full-year 2020 gross throughput was only around four per cent lower compared to 2019,"" Craig Coburn, BP Midstream's chief financial officer, said on a company earnings call.
BP Midstream's River Rouge pipeline, which carries refined products to BP's Whiting refinery, and Diamondback pipeline, which transports diluent to Canada, both suffered lower volumes in the fourth quarter, Coburn said.
BP Midstream's net income for the fourth quarter was $40.8 million, about 10 per cent less than the previous quarter, Coburn said. The decline was due largely to decreased River Rouge, particularly in December, as a resurgence of coronavirus cases in parts of North America reduced demand for the pipeline.
In 2021, BP Midstream expects offshore pipeline volumes to increase from the previous year and on-land pipelines to stay flat.

"Biden, Trudeau Pledge To Counter China, Climate Change, In Warm First 'Meeting' | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought on Tuesday to turn the page on the Trump era, stressing the countries' deep ties and pledging to work together to counteract Chinese influence and address climate change.
""The United States has no closer friend, no closer friend than Canada,"" Biden told Trudeau via an electronic video link with the Canadian leader and top aides. ""That's why you were my first call as president [and] my first bilateral meeting,"" he said.
After talking for about two hours, the two leaders emerged and said they planned to work closely together to beat the COVID-19 pandemic and combat climate change, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
Trudeau also thanked Biden for reiterating U.S. support for the release of two Canadians held by China, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. ""Human beings are not bartering chips,"" Biden said. ""We're going to work together until we get their safe return.""
Biden and Trudeau did not take questions after delivering their remarks.
Trudeau welcomed the Biden administration, citing in particular Washington's renewed attention to climate change in contrast to former U.S. President Donald Trump.
“Thank you, again, for stepping up in such a big way on tackling climate change. U.S. leadership has been sorely missed over the past years,"" the prime minister said.
Canada has often been a U.S. president's first foreign stop, but the COVID-19 pandemic turned the sit-down between the two leaders and some of their top deputies into a virtual affair.
Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials, all wearing dark masks, sat at a long table in a White House meeting room, near a large video screen beaming in Trudeau's image from Ottawa.
A Canadian government source said there had been no progress on the possibility of Canada accessing COVID-19 vaccines produced in the United States. Canada is currently receiving doses from plants in Europe.
""We're focused on ourselves, the United States is focused on itself. They feel they have a supply shortage, so there is no news on that front,"" said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Rekindled alliance
Biden irritated Ottawa shortly after taking office on Jan. 20 by blocking the $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline project to pump oilsands crude from Alberta to Nebraska, and proposing a ""Buy American"" program aimed at directing more U.S. spending toward domestic manufacturers.
But the two leaders made clear they wanted to put the dispute behind them and work together.
The meeting drew scrutiny as an early view of Biden diplomacy. ""Everyone around the world is watching this meeting very closely. They will want to get what the Canadians got and they won't all succeed. This is the top level of access, the gold standard,"" a senior Western diplomat in Ottawa said.
“We feel we are off to the races here,"" the Canadian government source added.
Trudeau was the first world leader to congratulate Biden when the Democrat was declared the winner of the November election, illustrating the degree to which the close U.S. ally looks to move on from Trump’s four years in office.
The Republican former president, who often clashed with traditional allies on trade, imposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel. He travelled only once to Canada for a G7 meeting in 2018, and blasted Trudeau for being “very dishonest and weak” after he left.
Trump also forced the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, talks that consumed Trudeau's government for years.
Tuesday's session began with a 45-minute meeting between Biden, Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and their Canadian counterparts.
Another meeting with more officials followed. Trudeau was accompanied by his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, and others.
The official said the White House had expected Trudeau to raise the issue of the two Canadians detained by Beijing and charged with espionage after Canada’s detention of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., on a U.S. arrest warrant.
Meng remains under house arrest.
Biden also said the leaders would work closely to strengthen supply-chain security and resilience, and to drive a robust post-pandemic “economic recovery that benefits everyone, not just those at the top.”

Occidental Counts the Cost of Its Thwarted Permian Oil Ambitions | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– The decline in Occidental Petroleum Corporation's oil production in the Permian Basin has left the company with so much unused capacity on pipelines to the Gulf Coast that the problem will drive a midstream loss of as much as $750 million this year.
Occidental said Tuesday that total Permian production is expected to be about 485,000 boe/d this year, well short of the 800,000 bbls of pipeline space it’s committed to. That means the company needs to buy the balance elsewhere, adding to costs.
Occidental has long held more pipe space than it needs from the Permian, in the hope that its shale business would eventually grow big enough to make use of it. But last year’s oil-price crash, and, more recently, the winter freeze in Texas, caused the company to cut investment and production in an effort to prioritize near-term cash flow for debt reduction. That has left its pipeline position exposed.
Space capacity
Though oil flows should improve later in the year as Occidental restores production following the extremely cold weather, it will be some way off what’s needed to fill the pipes. Furthermore, unfavourable coastal crude prices compared with those inland may not be sufficient to cover the cost to transport the oil.
The situation appears to be a reversal of what happened in 2018, when pipeline capacity out of the Permian was in short supply and Occidental benefited handsomely from being able to buy barrels there cheaply and then sell them at a premium in Houston and Corpus Christi. In a single quarter that year, the midstream division earned $796 million, more than seven times what it made in the whole of 2017.
Times are tougher now. The company is managing a much higher debt load after its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, while oil prices have yet to fully recover from last year’s plunge. Occidental won’t post a quarterly profit again until 2023, according to the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Chief executive officer Vicki Hollub said Tuesday the company has so far been unable to reduce costs associated its long-term pipeline contracts, which roll off in 2025.
“We’ve had conversations with other companies and potential partners and we have not come across a solution that was acceptable to us from a value standpoint,” she said on the company’s earnings conference call. “We’re not willing to sacrifice value to do a deal that is going to negatively impact us in the future.”

"Reconciliation Crucial, Says CER’s New Chief Executive | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Ensuring that Indigenous groups are properly consulted on projects that affect them is crucial for the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) in its commitment to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, says the CER’s new chief executive officer. 
“Reconciliation matters to me deeply personally, it matters to the regulator and it is necessary,” Gitane De Silva said in a recent interview. “We have seen what happens when meaningful consultation and engagement does not happen in communities.”
“This is crucial to the resource industry, it's crucial to Canadians, it's crucial to Indigenous peoples, and so we are making sure that we fully understand the role that we play there and continue to try and move forward.”
It’s not enough that the CER consult with Indigenous peoples once it has developed a process or a policy but that it actually takes a step back and speaks to Indigenous peoples from the outset, she said.
The regulator, added De Silva, also needs to ensure that “we're incorporating their perspectives and that we are developing processes and policies that are accessible to them, that are meaningful to them and that allow us to have the conversations that are required to happen.”
The enabling legislation for the CER, which in 2019 replaced the 60-year-old National Energy Board (NEB), also requires that the new federal regulator set up an Indigenous advisory committee to provide strategic advice to the CER’s board of directors whose advisory role is similar to that of a corporate board.
A former diplomat who also served as Alberta’s deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs and senior representative in Washington, D.C., De Silva most recently worked as special advisor, external affairs, at TransAlta Corporation. She was sworn in as the CER's chief executive in August 2020. 
“Our intention of doing that is to really change drastically and fundamentally the way the regulator works,” said De Silva, who oversees the CER’s day-to-day operations. “This has been really important to bring this group on board and already we're seeing this change.”
The nine-member IAC includes members from the three national Indigenous organizations — the Assembly of First Nations, the Métis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami — with the remaining six members comprised of leaders from Indigenous communities across Canada.
While committee members do not advise the CER board on individual projects, they will be offering advice as the regulator begins to review applications under the Canadian Energy Regulator Act. (For the first year of operation, it was still reviewing applications that had come in under the old National Energy Board Act.) 
“So now that we are the CER, taking these applications under the CER Act, we are the Crown,” said De Silva. “So we've consulted with the IAC on how we can better do Crown consultation.” This provides certainty to those communities, the project proponents and to stakeholders, she said. “So we see this really as a win-win-win.”
The CER also is looking at its approach to Indigenous monitoring broadly with Indigenous monitoring advisory committees, both on the Trans Mountain expansion project and on Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement project, said De Silva. “This is an opportunity for impacted communities to be at the table with us as the regulator with the company and with NRCan (Natural Resources Canada) to discuss a whole variety of issues and we've seen great success there.”
On the Trans Mountain expansion, the CER recently completed its 50th joint verification activity with Indigenous monitors while it has now done more than 30 on Line 3. “This is really tremendously changing the relationship with these communities because they are included,” she said. “They can see what's going on. They know how their lands are impacted, they can ask questions, they can share their experience with us.”
For its part, the CER is providing monitors with meaningful training on items such as emergency response. “We see that as a very positive step so far and something that we look forward to continuing,” said De Silva.
One of the advantages of the new governance structure of the regulator is that the CEO is not responsible for energy adjudication: that is the role of an independent Commission, she noted. “So it's my job, really, to get out and speak to people about who we are and what we do and help them to better access our processes in order to make ourselves a better regulator.”
And the mission of the CER is clear: it is responsible for regulating infrastructure to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of energy while protecting the environment, said De Silva. “So for us, it's not an ‘either/or,’ it's an ‘and.’”
As a life cycle regulator, the CER must consider this balance at every stage in the energy project, she said. “It’s considered at the hearing step and then in the conditions for approved projects, how we conduct our inspections and oversight, and then considering those same things as you move through construction, operation and, ultimately, to abandonment.”
In focusing on harm prevention, the CER also looks to develop and enforce rules to protect people, the environment, energy markets and the economy, she said. “We focus on environmental sustainability by considering the impacts of these projects, including what that means for climate change, and then also ensuring that the decisions are informed by the best possible evidence and science, with input from diverse people across Canada.”
The CER in its role as a life cycle regulator also is looking at potential opportunities for innovation. “Typically, we don't look to pick winners and losers when it comes to technology,” said De Silva. “We want to focus on outcomes and ensuring the safety of the system, the safety of people and the safety of the environment.”
Regulated companies may propose a new technology and “we are really trying to focus on the solution side of things. Not to say, ‘no,’ but how can we make that work,” in providing an opportunity for a company to pilot a technology.
The CER currently is conducting its regular cyclical review of onshore pipeline regulations and part of the conversation is how it can better incorporate innovative approaches, she noted.   
De Silva also acknowledged that when people hear the word innovation, they don’t automatically think of government or the regulator. “But we … very much have a culture of continuous learning and continuous improvement,” she said. “So, we're fortunate to have a highly professional, highly educated staff that are really experts in their field and are always keeping on top of what the latest advancements are.”
As the industry moves to economic recovery, the CER also is looking at its role in enhancing competitiveness, which is directly referred to in the legislation which established it.
Another issue is the role of the regulator in ESG (environment, social and governance), which is increasingly important for industry. “What is the role of the regulator in driving innovation towards a lower carbon economy?”
At a minimum, the CER needs not to prevent innovation and then it's a question of how far it goes in incenting innovation, said De Silva. “This is an incredibly innovative industry, so we want to make sure we're not standing in their way.”
The advancement of data and digital innovation also is an important focus of the regulator. The CER is working to make the 60 years of information it has stored in various formats accessible to its own staff members and to Canadians as a whole, helping to improve energy literacy.
Although up until now it has focused on data visualization and extracting that information, the regulator is now in the process of looking at the areas of greatest interest and prioritizing that information.
The CER also has partnered with StatsCanada in the Canadian Centre for Energy, which also provides some useful opportunities and the potential for co-operating on innovative projects, she said. “We can provide the energy data and then they have the ability to do broader social economic impact analysis for the impacts of those types of things.”
Role of CER
Although the CER may not be a household name, it regulates more than 73,000 kilometres of pipeline from coast to coast, along with international power lines, some inter-provincial power lines, and the export and import of energy into and out of Canada. “So we have a presence across the country, in many people's backyards, and in many people's communities,” noted De Silva. “And obviously, the energy sector is hugely important to Canada's economy.”
When she joined the CER in August 2020, De Silva made it a priority to speak to as many people as possible about their views of the regulator and what they expected from it. “And really, we're just at this crucial nexus of energy, the environment, reconciliation and landowners’ rights.”
The CER’s primary focus is safety — safely operating infrastructure, protecting the safety of people and of the environment. “And then, just making sure that people have trust and confidence in us as a regulator, of course, is crucial as well,” she said. “We can't do our job unless people trust that we're doing it well and so that means getting out and talking to people, demystifying our process, making ourselves more accessible and more transparent.”
According to De Silva, Canadians expect the regulator to move forward and to do that in as transparent a way as possible. “We are overseeing companies every step of the way, from when an application first comes in, through to construction, through operation and ultimately, to the abandonment phase of a piece of infrastructure that has fulfilled its useful life,” she said. “And at every step of the way, we're telling Canadians what we're doing and where we're providing that oversight role.”
The CER posts on its website any enforcement action and any audits it conducts of the companies it regulates. “And that is really key so that people understand not only the role of the regulator, but that transparency is key in increasing the trust and confidence that we're fully exercising our role in oversight and enforcement.”
The regulator also posts information on items such as audits so that another industry can learn from it. “Our expectation is that when we find things in one regulated part of regulated industry, that those lessons are learned across regulated industry.”

Trans Mountain Seeking CER Approval For Confidential Filing Of Information On Insurers | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Citing pressure on its insurers from environmental activists that ultimately could mean higher tolls for shippers, Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC wants the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to allow it to file the names of its insurers on a confidential basis.
Insurance companies recently have faced negative pressure for insuring the Trans Mountain pipeline and there is evidence that certain parties have used public filings from the CER’s database to identify insurers in order to pressure them to drop their policy for the pipeline, Trans Mountain says in filing with the CER.
“If the name of Trans Mountain’s insurers is disclosed publicly, ongoing targeting and pressure on those insurers to stop insuring the pipeline are likely to result in material loss to Trans Mountain and its shippers,” says Trans Mountain. This could take the form of higher insurance premiums (due to a smaller pool of insurers available to Trans Mountain) and challenges in maintaining adequate insurance coverage to fulfill its significant financial resource obligations under section 138 of the CER Act, it says.
Trans Mountain says it already has observed increasing reluctance from insurance companies to offer insurance coverage for the pipeline and to do so at a reasonable price. For example, in 2020 it experienced a significant reduction in available insurance capacity. While it sought and secured partial replacement policies to compensate for the reduction, it did so at a significantly higher cost, says the company.
Under Trans Mountain’s Incentive Tolling Settlement, shippers bear the increase in insurance premiums as a flow through cost in the revenue requirement, the company points out. Further, given the significantly large amount of insurance required to partially fulfill Trans Mountain’s $1-billion financial requirement obligation, a reduction in insurers willing to participate has the potential to limit Trans Mountain’s ability to access adequate levels of insurance coverage at reasonable cost, it says.
“As such, any further impacts to Trans Mountain’s ability to maintain adequate coverage and to do so at competitive prices as a result of public disclosure of the Confidential Information will cause material prejudice to Trans Mountain and its shippers,” according to the company.
In addition, disclosure of the confidential information could also reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of Trans Mountain’s insurers, says Trans Mountain.
“If the name of Trans Mountain’s insurers is disclosed publicly, it could reasonably be expected that insurers named in the certificate of insurance will be targeted and pressured, as they have been recently,” it says. “Such targeting and pressure has included letters and petitions to Trans Mountain’s insurers stating that insuring Trans Mountain’s assets and similar pipelines will pose “significant reputational risks” and “undermine the continued viability” of their businesses.
The confidential information, which reveals parties to a commercial contract, is commercial in nature and the potential impacts of public disclosure include negative financial and competitive impacts, says Trans Mountain. It adds that it is not aware of any prejudice to a third party arising from the redaction of the limited confidential information from its CER filings.
Trans Mountain also points out that in a 2019 decision, the National Energy Board (NEB), the CER’s predecessor, granted requests from Genesis Pipeline Canada Ltd. and NOVA Chemicals (Canada) Ltd., who had requested that the names of the insurers specific to each policy be treated confidentially in all future filings of their certificates of insurance. In its decision, the board determined the interest of Genesis and NCCL in confidentiality outweighed the public interest in disclosure.
In its CER filing, Trans Mountain requests that the regulator also permit the confidential filing of the names of insurers in future years as the certificate of insurance must be filed annually as part of the update to Trans Mountain’s Financial Resources Plan. “The need for confidential treatment of the names of Trans Mountain’s insurers as set out above is very unlikely to change in the future, and it would be an inefficient use of Trans Mountain and CER resources to require Trans Mountain to reapply for confidential treatment every year,” says the company.

Gibson Proves Resilient Through Challenging Year | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Gibson Energy Inc.’s marketing segment faces continued challenges to start 2021, with few current opportunities available, says top brass, but the market likely will shift later on during the year — the inverse of 2020.
“We expect marketing performance to improve, at some point, through the year,” Steve Spaulding, president and chief executive officer, told this morning’s Q4 2020 conference call. He said in 2020, by comparison, the marketing segment moved decisively to lock in meaningful gains early on, but in the back half it faced harsher conditions.
“One area where we are seeing noticeable improvement coming into 2021 is in our commercial discussions. On the tankage front, we’re having numerous conversations with customers for tankage at both Hardisty and Edmonton. One of the drivers for tankage at Edmonton is TMX. Discussions on the [diluent recovery unit] have also moved forward. Clarity on KXL helps. We’re currently talking to multiple producers and multiple refiners.”
For 2020, Gibson proved to be resilient through a challenging year for the energy sector, according to management. This was due to a strategic focus on long-term, stable infrastructure cash flows, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and not relying on variable businesses to fund the dividend and capital program.
Despite COVID-19, the company brought into service — on schedule and on budget — three tanks that represent 1.5 million bbls of storage at the Hardisty Terminal’s Top of the Hill portion, increasing Gibson’s in-service tankage at the Hardisty Terminal to approximately 13.5 million bbls.
Spaulding added: “We also significantly progressed our ESG and sustainability practice, publishing our inaugural sustainability report and achieving an A-rating on our first [carbon disclosure project] submission.”
At least half of this year’s growth capital spending will go towards projects beneficial on an environmental, social, governance (ESG) and sustainability basis, says management, whether that be directly to Gibson or in the infrastructure built on behalf of the company’s customers.
In December, Gibson approved a 2021 growth capital expenditure budget of up to $200 million with an additional allocation of between $25 million and $30 million in replacement capital expenditures. About two-thirds of spending is currently sanctioned, or is likely to be.
Gibson also finalized long-term, take-or-pay agreements with ConocoPhillips Canada during the fourth quarter to underpin and sanction the initial 50,000 bbls/d of DRU inlet bitumen capacity phase, having continued to progress the construction while tracking within target costs and towards an in-service date of mid-2021.
“This is really our first commercial DRU in Canada, and we think that it’s a real opportunity,” Spaulding told the conference call. “I think clarity around KXL has certainly helped, and discussions have picked up as we continue to talk to multiple producers and refiners.
“You have that U.S. pull, and now that KXL is kind of cleared up, feedstock coming from Venezuela and Mexico continue to decline, and so those U.S. refineries need that heavy crude oil produced by Canada. Likewise, the Canadian producers want that U.S. market. We think this is a real opportunity for them, and discussions continue to heat up.”
Advancing several U.S. infrastructure projects, such as completion of the Gibson Wink Terminal, connections to adjacent terminals and pipelines, as well as extending the reach of Gibson’s gathering pipeline network, also represent priorities for the company in 2021.
Even though the current environment for its marketing segment is challenged, Sean Brown, senior vice-president and chief financial officer, noted Gibson does not rely on that segment to execute on its strategy. “Our infrastructure segment had a very strong year, and marketing was within our long-term run-rate expectations.”
He added: “As we’ve always said with something like M&A, it’s not something we’re necessarily averse to, but the bar is so incredibly high, given the visibility that we have, there’s just nothing that’s cleared that hurdle.”

Q4 results
For the three and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2020, Gibson’s revenue totalled $1.32 billion and $4.94 billion, respectively, which is down 21 and 33 per cent from the same 2019 periods.
The infrastructure segment saw a $374 million full-year 2020 profit (including $93 million in Q4), which is up 19-per-cent over full-year 2019 results, mostly due to more in-service tankage at Hardisty. The full-year 2020 marketing segment profit totalled $95 million (including a $9 million Q4 loss), which is down 52 per cent from full-year 2019, due to reduced margins and limited crude marketing opportunities and reduced refined products sales volumes.
“[Marketing] remains a very challenging environment,” Brown said in the fourth quarter conference call. “Absent a change in that environment, it’ll be a fairly challenging quarter for the crude marketing business, given the very limited opportunities. Combine that with our outlook for refined products, where we continue to see reduced product demand due to the pandemic, and our outlook on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the quarter is around break-even.
“That being said, we do expect to see a recovery throughout the year, especially on the refined products side, and end-use finalizing with a more fulsome economic recovery given the rollout of the vaccine.”
Net income in Q4 and full-year 2020 was $12.44 million and $121.31 million, respectively, which is down 67 and 31 per cent from the same prior-year periods. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totalled $80.36 million and $447.5 million in Q4 and full-year 2020, respectively, compared with $125.95 million and $459.22 million for the comparative timeframes one year prior.
In Q4 2020, Gibson transitioned to an investment grade capital structure by issuing $650 million of senior unsecured medium-term notes and $250 million of hybrid subordinated notes, as well as redeeming in full $600 million 5.25-per-cent notes due in 2024 and $100 million convertible debentures due in 2021, resulting in annualized interest savings of approximately $16 million over the remaining term of the redeemed notes.
Dividend declared
This week, the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 35 cents per common share, which is a one-cent increase. The dividend will be payable on April 16 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 31. This dividend is designated as an eligible dividend for Canadian income tax purposes.
Gibson’s infrastructure business demonstrated resilience through 2020, which gives the company confidence that it can continue growing its dividend without compromising on its strong financial position and adherence to its financial governing principles, according to Spaulding.
“In particular, this would include not relying on the variable part of our business to remain fully-funded for all anticipated capital growth as well as both our dividends and leverage being fully underpinned by ratable, highly-contracted cash flows from our Infrastructure segment.”

Brookfield Formally Launches Hostile Bid To Buy Inter Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. on Monday formally launched a hostile bid to buy Inter Pipeline Ltd. with the same C$16.50-per-share offer that Inter had rejected as inadequate.
Earlier this month, Brookfield said it was willing to raise its offer to as much as C$18.25 per Inter share if the company comes to the negotiating table, but Inter turned it down and later launched a strategic review of options.
The current offer from Brookfield, which acquires and manages infrastructure assets, values Inter at C$7.08 billion (US$5.62 billion).
The investment firm earlier this month also said it had acquired a 19.65 per cent economic interest in Inter Pipeline, to become the top shareholder in the Calgary-based company.
Brookfield said on Monday that other shareholders now have until June 7 to accept its offer at the original C$16.50 per share with an option to take that amount in cash or Brookfield's shares.
Inter Pipeline said separately that its special committee is reviewing the offer and will make a recommendation within 15 days.
""It is the board's duty to not only review this offer, but to pursue all available opportunities to unlock maximum value for our shareholders,"" the company said in a statement, urging shareholders to not take any action on the hostile offer.
Inter, whose assets include more than 7,000 kilometres, of oil pipelines, five million bbls of oil storage in Western Canada and natural gas liquids processing plants, said on Thursday its formal review could include a possible ""corporate transaction"" but no decisions have been made yet.
Brookfield Infrastructure has engaged BMO Capital Markets and Barclays Capital Canada Inc. to act as joint financial advisers.

Interior Pick Haaland Draws GOP Ire With Fracking Opposition | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) –– Interior Secretary-designate Deb Haaland’s opposition to fracking, early endorsement of the Green New Deal and participation in protests against an oil pipeline in South Dakota have made her one of President Joe Biden’s most controversial cabinet nominees.
Haaland, a Democratic representative from New Mexico, will face questions about those and other positions during a confirmation hearing Tuesday, with some Republicans already warning she’s unlikely to get their support.
“I have serious concerns with Rep Haaland’s radical views and support for the Green New Deal,” Senator Steve Daines, a Montana Republican and member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee vetting her nomination, tweeted after a meeting with Haaland. “Unless my concerns are addressed, I will not only oppose her confirmation for Interior, I will do all I can to defeat it.”
Haaland plans to tell skeptical senators she recognizes the role of fossil fuels in the U.S. energy mix, while emphasizing climate change is a problem that can’t be ignored, according to a copy of her committee testimony released Monday.
“There’s no question that fossil energy does and will continue to play a major role in America for years to come,” Haaland says in the testimony, adding that revenue from oil and gas fund critical services. “But we must also recognize that the energy industry is innovating, and our climate challenge must be addressed.”
The Senate ultimately is still expected to confirm Haaland but the slim control Democrats have means Haaland needs every vote she can get. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the committee considering her nomination, threw into doubt the fate of another Biden nominee last week. Manchin said he would vote against Neera Tanden to be budget director though the president vowed to press on with the nomination.
Early Monday, two moderate Republicans –– Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah –– also said they would object to Tanden, making her path to confirmation even more difficult.
Haaland’s nomination has become a target for oil industry advocates, who question whether her past views will get in the way of legal obligations to advance energy development on territory under the Interior Department’s control. The agency runs the national park system and oversees grazing, recreation, energy development and other activities on about a fifth of U.S. land.
Native American
Haaland, who is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, would become the first Native American member of a president’s cabinet.
Haaland’s past stances and statements, however, have unnerved the oil industry.
“It is one thing to hold those views” as a lawmaker and political organizer, said Anne Bradbury, head of the American Exploration and Production Council. which represents oil developers. “But it is a very different constituency and a very different responsibility to then transition over to running a large federal bureaucracy that is charged with executing –– not making –– the law.”
Policies Haaland charts at Interior could have a dramatic effect on U.S. energy development. Federal lands and waters made up roughly 22 per cent of U.S. crude and 12 per cent of U.S. natural gas in 2019, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
“That supply is really the difference between greater energy security and going back to the past where we were more reliant on foreign energy,” said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice-president of the American Petroleum Institute (API)
Big Oil
Haaland’s supporters say her nomination has drawn criticism because she’s not beholden to Big Oil.
“Representative Haaland makes people uncomfortable because she has opinions,” said Raul Grijalva, a Democratic congressman from Arizona. “And she makes gas and oil uncomfortable because she’s not a cheerleader for them.”
Biden nominated Haaland after a months-long campaign by Native Americans and environmental activists, who have said she would reset the Interior Department’s relationship with tribal nations and would bring a fresh perspective to the agency most frequently led by White, male Western politicians.
The department holds trust title to more than 56 million acres for tribal nations, and its Bureau of Indian Affairs works directly with 578 federally recognized tribes.
Haaland cuts a different figure as a single mother who at times relied on food assistance. She was a tribal administrator of the San Felipe Pueblo as well as the operator of a small salsa-making business. She’s represented New Mexico in the U.S. House since 2019.
“She’s going to bring a commitment to environmental and climate goals to an agency that under Trump was run by actual folks who had worked for fossil fuel corporations,” said Julian Brave NoiseCat, vice-president of policy and strategy at the liberal advocacy group Data for Progress.
In 2016, Haaland brought food to Standing Rock Sioux protesters camped along the route of Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access oil pipeline. She was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution in the House, which outlines a progressive vision for rapidly decarbonizing the American economy. Haaland also has said she’s “wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands.”
Haaland has “radical views” that “are squarely at odds with the responsible management of our nation’s energy resources,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the top-ranking Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
“Representative Haaland must demonstrate that she will follow the law, protect the multiple uses of our public lands and reject policies that will force energy workers into the unemployment line,” Barrasso said in an emailed statement. “I won’t support her nomination otherwise.”
Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said in an interview he would press for Haaland to recuse herself from decisions on those issues. “She’s already committed to certain policy approaches that I think go against the law.”

Higher Oil And Petrochemical Prices Have Inter Pipeline Optimistic About Future Despite Current Ownership Debate | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
With his company targeted for takeover by Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P., Inter Pipeline Ltd. chief executive officer Christian Bayle laid out an optimistic picture of future growth to analysts during the company’s year-end conference call on Friday.
Higher oil prices, combined with new export pipelines coming onstream in the next few years, should increase throughput on its oilsands and conventional oil pipelines Bayle said.
“In the near term, growth looks challenging but we’re optimistic for the future,” Bayle said of the company’s oilsands assets.
Recent consolidation of oilsands operators has improved their financial strength, he pointed out. Add to that the expected completion of Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement project and the Trans Mountain expansion project and Bayle said he expects future expansion of oilsands production.
“We have 2.3 million barrels per day of available capacity,” he added.
Inter Pipeline's oilsands transportation business generated record financial results in 2020. Annual funds from operations were $615.5 million, an increase of $11.9 million compared to the full-year 2019. This increase was as a result of higher capital fee revenue from the Cold Lake and Polaris pipeline systems. This business generates cash flow from a variety of long-term, cost-of-service contracts and is not materially impacted by throughput volume fluctuations.
Average throughput volume was 1,321,500 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 1,324,900 in the final quarter of 2019.
Inter Pipeline has also expanded its network of conventional oil pipelines, positioning itself for future growth as oil prices recover, said Bayle.
In the first half of 2020, the 75-kilometre Viking Connector pipeline and 260,000-bbl storage tank expansion project was placed into service on time and on budget. This $180 million investment concluded the first two-phases of Inter Pipeline's Central Alberta pipeline system and provides enhanced access to the Edmonton market hub and additional market flexibility for producers.
In the third quarter of 2020, Inter Pipeline reached an agreement to acquire the Milk River pipeline system from Plains Midstream Canada ULC in exchange for its 100 per cent ownership interest in the Empress II and 50 per cent ownership interest in the Empress V straddle plants. Inter Pipeline will also receive cash proceeds of $35 million. Closing of this transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2021, following completion of customary conditions.
“We expect volumes to trend higher to pre-pandemic levels,” he said.
Year over year, the conventional oil pipeline systems reported an average volume of 161,600 bbls/d in 2020, down 13 per cent from 2019.
Bayle also said improvements in petrochemical pricing are adding to the economics of the Heartland Petrochemical Complex (HPC) currently moving towards completion.
“The spread between propane and polypropylene has widened to approximately US$1,800 per tonne in January, roughly 35 per cent higher than the five-year historical average,'' he said “This strengthening in price materially improves the indicative economics for current and prospective propane and polypropylene customers.''
The HPC on track and on budget for early 2022 production. The propane dehydrogenation facility is expected to be substantially mechanically complete by May 2021, and the polypropylene facility by the end of the year. The full HPC in-service date remains early 2022.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Inter Pipeline invested approximately $270 million on the HPC project, bringing the total capital investment to approximately $3.2 billion.
Significant work performed at site in 2020 included installation of remaining modules and major equipment.
At the propane dehydrogenation facility, work has transitioned from general construction to systems completion. As systems are completed, they are being turned over to the start-up and commissioning teams.
At the polypropylene facility, notable 2020 installations included completion of the reactor structure, pelletizer and flare stack. In addition, the railyard was completed which will enable HPC to ship polypropylene to various North American markets.
The process to secure a partner to purchase a material interest in the Heartland Petrochemical Complex is ongoing and is expected to conclude in the first half of 2021.
While providing a positive outlook for the company, Bayle was less clear on how he expected the company’s strategic review in response to the Brookfield takeover offer would play out, saying only, “no timetable has been set and no decisions have been made in the process.”

Indigenous Advisory Committee To Bring Broader Perspective To CER | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator’s (CER) board of directors and its Indigenous Advisory Committee (IAC) have developed and endorsed the terms of reference for the committee, representing a key milestone in its development.
As set out in the foundational document, the committee’s work and advice will be grounded in advancing reconciliation by helping to transform the relationship between the CER and the Indigenous peoples of Canada. Its advice will bring a broader perspective to the CER reflecting the worldviews of First Nations, the Métis Nation and Inuit, says the CER.  The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), the federal Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, and the Principles Respecting the Government of Canada’s Relationship with Indigenous peoples will form the foundation, and provide the roadmap, for the committee’s work.
According to the CER, the committee’s integral role within the regulator’s new governance structure will allow for the development of strong relationships between the committee and the CER. “These relationships will help build trust and mutual capacity, and provide an opportunity for frank discussions, shared learnings, and the promotion of positive systemic change within the CER and its regulated industry,” it says.
While the committee will provide advice to the CER’s board of directors at a broad and strategic level, it also will have tangible impacts in the day-to-day operations of the regulator. The CER will, for example, seek the committee’s advice on approaches to Indigenous peoples’ involvement in CER compliance and oversight activities, and on the implementation of UNDRIP within the CER’s mandate. This advice will bring meaningful changes to the way the CER works, including in its oversight, expectations and requirements of its regulated companies.
The work of the IAC will also build on, and support, other initiatives that the CER has undertaken to advance reconciliation, such as with the Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring Committees for the Trans Mountain existing pipeline and expansion and the Line 3 replacement program.
The committee was established in August 2020 to fulfill a key requirement of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act for the establishment of an advisory committee to enhance the involvement of the Indigenous peoples of Canada and Indigenous organizations in the CER’s regulated infrastructure. The committee also supports the CER’s work to advance reconciliation.
The committee, alongside the board of directors, commission and CEO, is an integral part of the CER’s governance structure. The IAC is not a decision-making body, nor does it engage in CER operational matters or provide advice on any particular decision, order or recommendation made by the CER commission or other CER adjudicative decision-makers.
The IAC’s nine members are leaders at the local, regional and national level, are respected voices of their communities, and bring deep experience in the energy and natural resources sector. The committee also reflects the diversity of First Nations, Métis Nation and Inuit communities, languages, genders, geographies, and skills and expertise.
Three committee members are nominated directly by national Indigenous organizations: the Assembly of First Nations, the Métis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.
The current leadership selected by the committee consists of Tribal Chief Tyrone McNeil, the interim chair, and Kaella-Marie Earle, interim vice-chair.
“In building strong, long-term relationships with the CER, the Indigenous Advisory Committee has an opportunity to bring Indigenous worldviews into the governance and work of the federal regulator, furthering the implementation of the UN Declaration toward understanding, respect and recognition of Indigenous values and rights,” McNeil said in a statement.
“Reconciliation is a strategic priority for the CER,” said Cassie Doyle, chair of the board of directors of the CER. “The advice of the Indigenous Advisory Committee will be invaluable, helping the board incorporate critical Indigenous voices and perspectives in its governance of the CER and moving us forward along our path of reconciliation.”
The advice of the committee also will help the CER to better incorporate Indigenous worldviews and perspectives, as it works to create a more inclusive and effective regulatory system, added Gitane De Silva, the regulator’s chief executive officer.

TC Energy ‘Affirms’ 0.70 Share-For-Unit Exchange Ratio In TC PipeLines Deal | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation is maintaining its exchange ratio to acquire TC PipeLines, LP at 0.70.
TC Energy said today it was responding to a unitholder’s recent assertion of the inadequacy of the exchange ratio in the definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common units of TC PipeLines, LP not beneficially owned by TC Energy or its affiliates.
The exchange ratio of 0.70 of a TCE common share for each TCP common unit represents a 20.8 per cent premium to the TCP closing price before the original offer as of Oct. 2, 2020. The exchange ratio was unanimously approved by a conflicts committee composed of independent directors of the Partnership’s general partner, after consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, said the company.
“We affirm the exchange ratio and we are confident that the meaningful transaction premium presents the best opportunity for TCP’s unitholders to maximize value. TC Energy will not increase the exchange ratio or vary any of the terms of the merger. If the merger is not completed, the Partnership will remain a publicly traded limited partnership,” said Francois Poirier, TC Energy president and chief executive officer.

U.S. Polar Vortex Drives Strong Demand For TC Energy Pipelines | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation pipelines experienced unprecedented and sustained demand for its pipeline capacity over the past week as a polar vortex covered most of the United States, the company’s new chief executive said Thursday.
The company set a record for coincidental three-day peak deliveries of more than 101 bcf from Feb. 14-16, 2021, Francois Poirier, president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call to discuss 2020 fourth quarter and year financial results. Those volumes exceeded the previous mark set in January 2019 by about 2.5 bcf/d, he said.
Poirier also thanked employees who, despite trying personal circumstances, continue to ensure TC Energy delivers the energy people need.
“Both our pipelines and our people performed extraordinarily well during the ongoing cold snap,” with record throughput levels across TC Energy’s 13 owned and operated pipeline networks, added Stan Chapman, executive vice-president and president of U.S. and Mexico natural gas pipelines. The Columbia Gulf pipeline on Feb. 15, 2021 also set a new peak day delivery record, sending out more than 3.2 bcf, he said. The same day, the company delivered just over 34 bcf of gas, the second-highest peak day volume.
Asked whether TC Energy might rethink the extent and pace of electrifying its pipeline network faced with the current loss of power, Chapman said that for a relatively minor investment it’s likely it would install dual drives, enabling the company to switch back and forth between gas and electricity drives.
The company has about 240,000 horsepower of electric compression across its system and will continue to add electric compression where it makes sense. TC Energy recently approved a US$100 million project in Virginia where it will replace some older inefficient gas compression with new electric drives, possibly even dual drives, that would serve incremental load while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he said.
In the Liquids Pipelines segment, demand cratered in that many of the refineries the companies delivers to could not receive shipments as they did not have power, resulting in a number of delivery points under force majeure, said Bevin Wirzba, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines. “As such, even though our assets were very operational and functioning well, we had to similarly make a force majeure event in that we needed to park securely those volumes that were in our pipe.”
 TC believes this will clear up quite quickly and does not believe it will be material to the year, nor should it affect its customers in any material way, he said.

Coastal GasLink Costs Expected To Rise | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Project costs for Coastal GasLink are expected to increase significantly, and the schedule will be delayed due, in part, to the impacts from COVID-19 as the company works with LNG Canada on a revised project plan, parent TC Energy Corporation said today.
Due to COVID-19, in late December the British Columbia Provincial Health Officer issued an order restricting the workforce to approximately 600 people. Coastal GasLink has since received provisional approval from the public health authorities to increase the workforce over the coming weeks.
More than 950 people are now mobilized with a gradual deployment of additional personnel across the route in the coming weeks with a focus on seasonally critical activities in compliance with the public heath order and environmental permitting and regulatory commitments, Suzanne Wilton, a company spokesperson, said in an email.
Scope increases and permit delays also will contribute to the higher costs, although Coastal GasLink will continue to mitigate these impacts to the extent possible, said TC Energy. Wilton said cost and schedule impacts continue to be assessed, but she doesn’t have any information as to when those reviews will be complete.
The incremental costs will be included in the final pipeline tolls, subject to certain conditions. The company, though, said it does not anticipate a significant increase in future equity contributions following the conclusion of the review process.

Oilsands Pipelines Drive Positive Results For Inter Pipeline In 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Record results in its oilsands transportation business helped Inter Pipeline Ltd. weather what was a tough 2020 for many in the oil and gas industry.
Inter Pipeline reported net income of $359 million in 2020 on revenues of $2.4 billion compared with a net income of  $539 million in 2019 on revenues of $2.54 billion.
In the fourth quarter, the company reported net income of $169 million on revenue of $624 million, compared with net income of $100 million on revenue of $644 million in the same period of 2019.
For 2020, Inter Pipeline generated funds from operations of $792 million, nine per cent lower than 2019. Fourth quarter funds from operations in 2020 totalled $204 million, down six per cent from the comparable quarter of 2019.
On the heels of an unsolicited offer by Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. to buy Inter Pipeline, Inter on Thursday formally launched a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives.
Oilsands transportation
Inter Pipeline's oilsands transportation business generated record financial results in 2020. Annual funds from operations were $615.5 million, an increase of $11.9 million compared to the full-year 2019. This increase was as a result of higher capital fee revenue from the Cold Lake and Polaris pipeline systems. This business generates cash flow from a variety of long-term, cost-of-service contracts and is not materially impacted by throughput volume fluctuations.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, funds from operations were $154.0 million, consistent with the same period in 2019.
Average throughput volume was 1,321,500 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 1,324,900 in the final quarter of 2019.
NGL processing
NGL processing business generated annual funds from operations of $189.7 million in 2020, compared to $236.6 million in 2019. These results were primarily impacted by depressed frac-spread pricing in both its natural gas and offgas processing operations, offset slightly by higher throughput volumes, said the company.
For 2020, Inter Pipeline's three straddle facilities produced 108,300 bbls/d of ethane and propane-plus, which was consistent with 2019 levels. Annual sales volume from the Redwater Olefinic Fractionator improved year over year to a record 34,900 bbls/d, representing a nine per cent increase compared to 2019.
Funds from operations from this business were $58.5 million for the fourth quarter 2020, an increase of $8.2 million from the same quarter in 2019. This increase was primarily driven by improved paraffinic and propane-plus frac spread pricing during quarter and lower operating costs.
Inter Pipeline's Cochrane and Empress straddle facilities produced 91,200 bbls/d of propane-plus and ethane during the quarter. Average sales volume from the Redwater Olefinic Fractionator for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 36,500 bbls/d, an increase of approximately eight per cent compared to the same period in 2019.
Heartland Petrochemical Complex (HPC)
Inter Pipeline concluded HPC's third year of construction with all major milestones met. The project continues to track the revised schedule and cost estimate. The propane dehydrogenation facility is expected to be substantially mechanically complete by May 2021, and the polypropylene facility by the end of the year. The full HPC in-service date remains early 2022.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Inter Pipeline invested approximately $270 million on the HPC project, bringing the total capital investment to approximately $3.2 billion.
Significant work performed at site in 2020 included installation of remaining modules and major equipment.
At the propane dehydrogenation facility, work has transitioned from general construction to systems completion. As systems are completed, they are being turned over to the start-up and commissioning teams.
At the polypropylene facility, notable 2020 installations included completion of the reactor structure, pelletizer and flare stack. In addition, the railyard was completed which will enable HPC to ship polypropylene to various North American markets.
The process to secure a partner to purchase a material interest in the Heartland Petrochemical Complex is ongoing and is expected to conclude in the first half of 2021.
Conventional oil pipelines
Results from the conventional oil pipeline business were impacted by lower global energy prices that resulted in lower production volumes and reduced marketing activities. Funds from operations for this business were $128.9 million, a decrease of $39.1 million compared to 2019.
Year over year, the conventional oil pipeline systems reported an average volume of 161,600 bbls/d in 2020, down 13 per cent from 2019.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, funds from operations were $34.5 million, a $10.1 million decrease from FFO of $44.6 during the comparable quarter in 2019. Average throughput volume for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 165,200 bbls/d, compared to 189,300 bbls/d during the same period in 2019.
In the first half of 2020, the 75-kilometre Viking Connector pipeline and 260,000-bbl storage tank expansion project was placed into service on time and on budget. This $180 million investment concluded the first two-phases of Inter Pipeline's Central Alberta pipeline system and provides enhanced access to the Edmonton market hub and additional market flexibility for producers.
In the third quarter of 2020, Inter Pipeline reached an agreement to acquire the Milk River pipeline system from Plains Midstream Canada ULC in exchange for its 100 per cent ownership interest in the Empress II and 50 per cent ownership interest in the Empress V straddle plants. Inter Pipeline will also receive cash proceeds of $35 million. Closing of this transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2021, following completion of customary conditions.
Bulk liquid storage  
In the fourth quarter 2020, Inter Pipeline completed the agreement to divest the majority of its European bulk liquid storage business to the CLH Group for approximately $727 million, before closing adjustments. Inter Pipeline retains eight terminals in Sweden and Denmark, comprising of approximately 19 million bbls of storage capacity.
The bulk liquid storage business reported record 2020 financial results, benefitting from nearly full capacity utilization during the year. With annual funds from operations of $129.2 million, this business posted a $14.2 million increase compared to 2019.

EPAC Loses Bid For Extension Of NGTL Temporary Service Protocol | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has denied, with reasons to follow, an application from the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) for an extension of the Temporary Service Protocol (TSP) on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) System.
The CER, however, has decided to require NGTL to address access to natural gas storage with an additional filing with the commission.
Under the CER order, by June 30, 2021, NGTL must either amend its existing tariff to facilitate access to storage and file the amended tariff with the commission for approval, or file a report containing specific information if it intends to address access to storage with a methodology or service that does not require a tariff revision.
The TSP, which expired Oct. 31, 2020, prioritized interruptible delivery and storage injection to manage system constraints during planned maintenance Upstream of James River. It was in effect for October 2019 and the summer of 2020 (April 1-Oct. 31) although it was not required last summer.
The CER’s 2019 approval of the TSP, brokered by the Alberta government, followed a summer in which natural gas prices had plummeted as producers were not able to access storage due to major outages on the NGTL System.
EPAC sought to have the TSP extended until the earlier of Oct. 31, 2021, or until leave to open of the final component of the NGTL 2021 system expansion project. In a three-day hearing last month, it argued the extension was necessary as work on the NGTL 2021 expansion has been delayed and it would enhance access to storage should the need arise in the summer of 2021.
Some producers, along with NGTL, opposed the extension, while others, backed by the Alberta government, supported EPAC.  
The commission of the CER held an initial comment process and then established an expedited process to consider the application, including a public hearing. The commission considered issues such as changed circumstances since the approval of the NGTL 2021 expansion, supply and markets (price volatility and access to storage), the feasibility of alternatives and toll principles (discrimination, economic efficiency and priority of service).

TC Energy Net Income Up In 2020 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, TC Energy Corporation’s operating assets were largely unaffected said the company in posting net income attributable to common shares of $4.56 billion ($4.74 per share) for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020, compared to net income of $3.98 billion ($4.28 per share) for 2019.
Net income was up slightly to $1.12 billion ($1.20 per share) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2020, from $1.11 billion ($1.18 per share) for the same period in 2019.
Revenue for the year was down slightly to $13 billion from $13.26 billion in 2019, while fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat at $3.3 billion (2019-$3.26 billion).
Comparable earnings in 2020 were $3.95 billion versus $3.85 billion the previous year, while fourth quarter 2020 comparable earnings rose to $1.08 billion from $970 million in 2019. The increases reflect the strong performance of its legacy assets and contributions from approximately $5.9 billion of growth projects that entered service in 2020, said the company.
Comparable EBITDA of $9.35 billion in 2020 declined from $9.37 billion in 2019 due in part to the net result of lower earnings from Liquids Pipelines reflecting lower uncontracted volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System, reduced contributions from liquids marketing activities and the July 2019 sale of an 85 per cent equity interest in Northern Courier.
Comparable EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.32 billion, in line with $2.32 billion in the 2019 quarter.
Comparable funds generated from operations were $7.39 billion (2019-$7.12 billion) for the year and $2.08 billion (2019-$1.83 billion) in the fourth quarter.
Capital spending for the year was $8.9 billion (2019-$8.78 billion) and $2.23 billion in the fourth quarter (2019-$2.36 billion).
TC Energy’s board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 87 cents per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, equivalent to $3.48 per common share on an annualized basis, an increase of 7.4 per cent.
“We are very pleased with the performance of our diversified portfolio of regulated and long-term contracted assets which generated record financial results again in 2020,” said François Poirier, TC Energy’s president and chief executive officer, who succeeded former CEO Russ Girling on Jan. 1, 2021.
Canadian natural gas pipelines 
Segmented earnings in Canadian natural gas pipelines increased to $1.66 billion in 2020 from $1.12 billion a year earlier, while fourth quarter 2020 segmented earnings rose to $350 million from $321 million in 2019.
TC Energy placed approximately $3.4 billion of NGTL System and $200 million of Canadian Mainline capacity projects into service during 2020.
The company also received federal cabinet approval for the NGTL System 2021 expansion program, which will add 1.45 bcf/d of incremental system capacity underpinned by long-term receipt and delivery contracts, connecting incremental supply to growing intra-basin and export markets.
 Compressor station field work began in December 2020 and pipeline construction activities got underway in January 2021. In-service is expected to begin in late 2021 with remaining program components completed by April 2022.
U.S. natural gas pipelines 
Segmented earnings for United States natural gas pipelines were $2.84 billion for the year and $730 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from $2.75 billion and $666 million in the respective 2019 periods (all in US dollars). 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, TC Energy approved the Wisconsin Access project that will replace, upgrade and modernize certain facilities while reducing emissions along portions of the ANR pipeline system. The enhanced facilities will improve reliability of the ANR pipeline system and also allow for additional contracted transportation services of approximately 72 mmcf/d to be provided to utilities serving the Midwestern U.S. under long-term contracts. The anticipated in-service date of the combined project is in the second half of 2022 with an estimated cost of $200 million.
 The US$200 million BXP project, a Columbia Gas project representing an upsizing of an existing pipeline replacement, in conjunction with the modernization program, was partially placed into service in October 2020 with full in-service beginning Jan. 1, 2021.
Mexico natural gas pipelines
Segmented earnings for the year in Mexico gas pipelines increased to $669 million from $490 million in 2019, while fourth quarter 2020 segmented earnings were essentially flat at $137 million versus $136 million a year earlier.
The Villa de Reyes project construction is ongoing. Phased in-service has been delayed due to COVID-19 contingency measures, which have impeded its ability to obtain work authorizations as a result of administrative closures, said TC Energy. Subject to the timely re-opening of government agencies, it expects to complete construction of the project in 2021.
A project to allow bidirectional flows at Guadalajara was completed in December 2020 and the TSA with the CFE was renegotiated. The bidirectional flow allows access to either LNG imports from the Manzanillo terminus or access to continental natural gas at the Guadalajara terminus for delivery to regional markets.
Liquids Pipelines 
Liquids Pipelines segmented earnings decreased to $1.36 billion for the year from $1.85 billion in 2019. Fourth quarter 2020 segmented earnings, which included unrealized losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives related to TC Energy’s liquids marketing business, declined to $300 million from $355 million in the 2019 quarter.
Keystone XL
Newly-elected United States President Joe Biden on Jan. 20, 2021, revoked the Presidential Permit for Keystone XL and TC Energy expects to record a substantive, predominantly non-cash, after-tax charge to its earnings in the first quarter of 2021, which will be excluded from comparable earnings, said Poirier.
The company said it is assessing its options along with its partner, the Alberta government, and other stakeholders. Accounting implications in first quarter 2021 and beyond will depend on the assessment and consideration of those options, including the impacts that this had on contractual arrangements, said TC Energy. “As a result, the magnitude of the impairment charge and related recoveries cannot be quantified at this time,” said the company.
The determination of the amount of the pre-tax impairment of the Keystone XL assets will consider the carrying value of the project and any associated projects, outstanding contractual commitments, the estimated net recoverable value of tangible plant and equipment and specified contractual recoveries, which cannot be reasonably estimated until the options have been assessed and next steps have been determined, it said.
The viability of certain projects currently associated with the Keystone XL pipeline is also is under review, said TC Energy.

TC Energy Declares Force Majeure On Oil Deliveries In Texas On Marketlink Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– TC Energy Corporation has declared force majeure on crude oil deliveries at destinations in Texas on its Marketlink pipeline, citing power outages caused by severe cold weather in the state, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Oil producers, pipelines and refiners in Texas and New Mexico have halted operations as they grapple with a rare deep freeze, which left nearly two dozen people dead and knocked out power to millions.
The Marketlink pipeline has a capacity of 750,000 bbls/d and flows south from Cushing to Nederland, Texas, according to Wood Mackenzie.
A TC Energy spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company told shippers on Wednesday night the system is still operational, but that they were facing issues making deliveries at Houston and Port Arthur, Texas, facilities due to power outages, according to the notice seen by Reuters.
More than two million bbls/d of pipeline capacity into the Gulf Coast was shut at some point on Monday, according to WoodMac, as freezing temperatures gripped the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top producing shale basin in the country.

"New U.S. Administration Holds Opportunities For Canada, Webinar Told | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The next four years under the administration of President Joe Biden offers an incredible opportunity for Canada to co-operate with the United States on energy and the environment and it’s time for Canada to seize that opportunity, a think tank webinar heard Tuesday.
Canada, though, can’t assume that it’s going to be a cakewalk simply because the two countries line up on those issues, Lisa Raitt, vice-chair of global investment banking for CIBC, told the Macdonald Laurier Institute event on Canada-U.S. relations, Building Across Borders. For a separate story on the event, click here.
“We're still going to have to have tough negotiations across the border,” warned the former natural resources minister. “We need to be smart and we need to be tough and we need to be prepared and we need to be principled in terms of what we want to accomplish for Canada going forward,” she said. “And we have to stand up for what we feel is in the best interests of Canada and do so in a respectful way.”
One of Biden’s first decisions was the cancellation of the presidential permit that former president Donald Trump had issued for the Keystone XL project. However, Maryscott Greenwood, chief executive of the Canadian American Business Council, said she believes there are other areas where the two countries can collaborate “frustrating as the KXL decision is and as much as it doesn't advance Canada-U.S. issues.”
The problems in the U.S. economy are pollution from cars and from power plants and leaking methane from oil and gas wells, providing an opportunity for potential co-operation that's quite meaningful, she said. In the power sector, examining ways to enhance the connectivity of Canadian hydro “would be amazing.”
Greenwood also cited the work on climate of Edmonton-based Capital Power, which has invested in a technology that captures carbon out of the atmosphere, turns it into nanotubes that then can be mixed into cement to build infrastructure. “So imagine a great infrastructure collaboration where you're actually reducing carbon and building new infrastructure,” she said. “There are really exciting things like that, between Canada and the United States that we could really look at doing more of.”
She also said there's a “massive role” for Canada to play as a source of critical minerals and rare earths. “That conversation has already started but it's not going fast enough.”
Gary Doer, former Canadian ambassador to the United States, said he would like to see the discussion on energy tied with climate, noting that both Canada and the United States have pledged to implement the Paris Accord. “I believe sustainability, cleaner air is also tied to reliability of clean energy across the border,” he said. “Whether it's hydro or oil or gas, we can benefit by having one table dealing with all the items, not just project by project.”
Methane emissions should also be discussed on both sides of the border, added Doer.
“And we should have, and I think it would be very popular in the United States and in Canada, to have clean, traditional energy policies that we work together on to make our traditional energies cleaner, but have complete reliability in the North American neighbourhood.”
JP Gladu, president of the Alaska-Alberta Railway, echoed Doer’s comments on the importance of a collaborative approach on energy and the environment.
“As the climate changes, we have to realize that we've got this shared ecological destiny and the search for solutions and we really have to be co-ordinated on that work across the boundaries.”
However, there are fundamental challenges, he said. “One is convincing America that we in Canada matter in the past and the present and going into the future and that continental solutions are really in everybody's interest,” said Gladu. The second is convincing Canadians that America is a vital part of Canada's prosperity as a series of markets and a source of investment capital ideas, entrepreneurial drive and global connections.
However, cracks are starting to emerge with Biden’s cancellation of the presidential permit for Keystone XL and that's going to fundamentally affect the Canada-U.S. relationship, said Gladu. He hopes the two countries will find solutions, recognizing they are stronger together than apart. “We need to build across those borders, we can collaborate on the energy and the environment.”
At the same time, there’s a need in Canada to start bringing Indigenous relationships closer to the front of the stage, especially when it comes to UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) and federal Bill C-15 which enshrines it, said Gladu, the former head of the Canadian Council on Aboriginal Business.  
Doer also pointed to other issues between Canada and the United States such as the state of Michigan’s attempts to shut down Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5 and opposition in the U.S. to a Hydro Quebec project to export hydropower to New England.
However, “the relationship is bigger than the problems that we're encountering,” countered Raitt, noting the similarities of the views of the two governments on issues of climate and infrastructure. On the other side of it, though, is U.S. talk about “Buy America,” she said.
“We could talk about the wonderful opportunities we have, in terms of clean tech, and we can talk about our great opportunities, in terms of moving forward together,” said Raitt. “But the reality is, is that if the old tropes of protectionism come back into play, Canada, if we're not very careful and watchful, could very much find itself on the outside, despite the fact there's so much similarity between what we have in administration in Canada [and] what we have in administration in the United States.”

"Cross-Border Energy Pact A Possible Option For Canada After Keystone XL Cancellation, Says Mintz | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Trying to get the new United States administration to agree to some sort of cross-border energy pact is one option the Canadian government might pursue after President Joe Biden cancelled the presidential permit for Keystone XL, says a Calgary academic.
“This [lifting of the permit] is actually a very serious issue and it needs to be dealt with and I don't think Canada can stand by this at all,” Jack Mintz, President’s Fellow at the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, said Tuesday in a pre-recorded presentation to a Macdonald Laurier Institute webinar on Canada-U.S. relations under the Biden administration.
It’s now time to “think of whatever policy alternatives that we can have for the future,” he added.  
An energy pact would take into account carbon issues in addition to oil, the construction of pipelines in North America as a whole, and the use of whatever oil that is going to be needed over the next several decades, said Mintz.
Carbon border adjustments could be a “very significant issue” down the road. Those carbon border adjustments could even be a means of retaliation for Canada — “really just a short run way of saying we need a better deal,” Mintz suggested. Canada, he said, could decide to put a carbon border adjustment on manufactured goods coming from the United States, “because they're not being as tough on carbon as we are.” The U.S. does not have a carbon tax and only a few states have a cap-and-trade system.
“That’s actually a very interesting thing to consider,” he said. “But I would rather see that as one in which we try to co-ordinate rather than create a huge amount of dislocation and economic costs associated with very bad decision-making.”
 “We have this huge resource in the ground — our oil and gas supplies— and we can sell LNG in terms of natural gas to the rest of the world and we can sell oil to the rest of the world,” said Mintz. “But right now over 90 per cent of our oil and gas goes down to [the] United States.”
He added: “And maybe we really do need to develop some other alternatives in order to give us … diversification in other markets, that could reduce risks.”
For example, there has been some serious interest in possibly using Churchill and Hudson Bay as a potential outlet for exporting oil.
There also have been discussions about moving crude by rail from Alberta to Alaska where it could be exported, but that also would require American co-operation to some extent, said Mintz.
“So, I think that those options are hard, but I should remind you that none of them probably would have necessarily the same best rates of return that we could get on various projects as Keystone XL.”

U.S. Lawmakers Ask Blinken For Briefing On Nord Stream 2 Pipeline | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Several U.S. Representatives on Wednesday raised pressure on the State Department to share plans on potential sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline Russia is racing to finish to take fuel to Europe.
“If completed, Nord Stream 2 would enable the Putin regime to further weaponize Russia's energy resources to exert political pressure throughout Europe,"" two Republicans including Michael McCaul, and two Democrats including Marcy Kaptur, wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
U.S. representatives and senators have said that the Biden administration has missed a deadline of Feb. 16 to issue Congress a report required by recently passed law on companies helping Russia’s state energy company Gazprom lay pipeline, insure vessels, and certify construction work.
Several companies, including Zurich Insurance Group have already left fearing sanctions and companies listed in report could drop out of the project, making completion difficult.
Nord Stream 2 is more than 90 per cent complete but requires additional tricky work in deep waters of the Baltic Sea off Denmark. The pipeline would bypass Ukraine, through which Russia has sent gas to Europe for decades, depriving it of lucrative transit fees and potentially undermining its struggle against Russian aggression.
The representatives asked Blinken for a briefing with State Department officials to inform them of the status of the report and their assessment of possible sanctionable activity of vessels believed to be helping to finish the project.
President Joe Biden believes the $11 billion pipeline, which would double the existing capacity of the Nord Stream system to take gas undersea to Germany, is a ""bad deal for Europe"" according to his press secretary Jen Psaki.
State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters last week that ""sanctions are only one"" of many tools and that the department will work closely with allies and partners to reinforce European energy security and to safeguard against “predatory behaviour.” The department did not immediately respond to a request about the requested briefing.
The representatives said the briefing should include details on “any proposals offered to the Biden administration on the future of the pipeline that aim to persuade the administration to forego or weaken the mandatory sanctions,"" apparently referring to any talks between Washington and Germany for a deal on the project.
Gazprom insists the project will be completed in 2021.

Pipeline Monitoring Takes To Outer Space | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Just as Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. has led the way toward development of electric vehicles, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX), which he launched to widely commercialize satellite technology, promises to lead to the development of a wide array of new technologies — including a more sophisticated and reliable way of monitoring oil and gas pipelines and other energy facilities.
Orbital Sidekick (OSK), which is headquartered in California’s Silicon Valley, was founded in 2016 by aerospace engineering veterans Dan Katz, the company’s CEO, and co-founder Tushar Prabhaker, who oversees product development, hardware design and operations for the start-up. Like Musk, they plan to become commercial satellite pioneers — and they’re well along the way to doing so.
Katz, who has a background in physics and astrophysics and is also an aerospace engineer, worked for a decade with space pioneering company SSL, formerly Space Systems/Loral LLC, which designs and builds satellites and space systems for a wide variety of governments and corporations. He worked with Prabhaker at that Palo Alto, California-based company.
“SSL is involved in developing large satellites for commercial customers and the defence industry,” said Katz. “While I was there I helped design 30 large, commercial satellites.”
Prabhaker, who also helped design satellite systems for SSL, also has a background in the energy sector, principally in the design of wind turbines. But he also was involved in the past in the fossil fuel infrastructure sector.
Katz said it was his partner who singled out the pipeline sector as a logical target for OSK’s technology.
With the advent of cheaper commercial satellites — the SSL satellites all involve investments in the millions of dollars — Katz said there will be many future uses. This includes providing guidance for self-driving vehicles, creating a more robust internet from space and in dozens of other applications.
For OSK the most immediate application was in the monitoring of energy infrastructure.
Katz said when he and Prabhaker started studying the possible application of satellite technology in the sector they were surprised to see the aerial monitoring technology that is now widely used.
“The industry now uses an aerial patrol approach, which consists of a pilot flying over a pipeline every few weeks to try to spot any anomalies with a camera or his eyes,” he said. “It’s basically to comply with regulatory requirements. When you talk to the pipeline operators they acknowledge that there is little real value in the approach.”
He found that to be somewhat surprising, given the sophisticated SCADA pipeline monitoring systems that are widely used in the pipeline sector.
But the good news is the hyperspectral imaging technology OSK is deploying is a perfect match for the computer-driven SCADA systems. It would also be cost-competitive with existing aerial detection approaches.
The company’s technology is a vast improvement over the human eye, with the ability to detect slight alterations in soils or other anomalies that human beings are unable to spot.
“About 95 per cent of pipelines are buried underground, so the human eye won’t detect leaks until it is too late,” said Katz. “With our technology we can identify topographigal and erosion changes or construction activity that affects pipelines long before leaks occur. It’s a powerful tool.”
But it’s a tool that wasn’t cost-effective or widely available before SpaceX and competitors entered the satellite market.
“This could not have happened five years ago, but now SpaceX and other commercial satellite alternatives allow start-ups to gain access to [the deployment of] space technologies,” he said. “That’s why we took the plunge and started OSK.”
He said his company can deploy its monitoring systems on a satellite for about $2 million for each application. By 2022 there will be another six commercial satellites launched by OSK, so the company’s energy monitoring technology should be widely available by then.
The company was able to raise US$3.5 million initially in venture capital in 2018 but the big funding breakthrough came in October, when it announced it had been awarded a US$16 million contract by the U.S. Air Force to accelerate the deployment of six advanced hyperspectral imaging satellites. Those will be designed to integrate with the Air Force’s Spectral Intelligence Global Monitoring Application and with its Advanced Battle Management System. The $16 million contract award was matched by private sector funding.
In mid-November Orbital Sidekick announced another significant development, when it said it had been awarded a 12-month contract as technology partner with the Intelligent Pipeline Integrity Program (iPIPE), a consortium of pipeline companies focused on detecting pipeline leaks. The goal is to implement Orbital’s aerial asset monitoring system by late 2021, in co-operation with the companies involved in the consortium. Those firms include Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. and TC Energy Corporation.
Katz said the OSK technology can be used to monitor other energy infrastructure beyond pipelines. “We have been heavily focused on pipelines, but our technology can be used to monitor other midstream energy assets, refineries and oil and gas extraction,” he said.
The potential application that is closest to his heart, given that he and the firm’s 12 employees all live and work in California, is the technology’s ability to monitor transmission lines and utility assets.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), the California-based utility, has been sued for billions of dollars for criminal negligence in connection with wildfires this year which destroyed thousands of hectares of forests and many homes, and also left dozens dead.
“We need to be able to detect the high risk areas” where power infrastructure can cause fires,” he said. “With our technology we can detect vulnerable areas.”
He said the company has worked with PG&E and its technology will be deployed this year. “We don’t even plan to make any money from deploying our technology for wildfire detection,” he said. “But global wildfires are responsible for about 20 per cent of the world’s carbon footprint, so it’s a very important area.”
There are other areas where the OSK technology can be used, including the agriculture sector, but for now the company plans to focus on the energy and utility sectors.
The fast-growing company is expected to employ at least 50 people by late 2021 or 2022, so it can tackle other potential markets in the future.
He sees a time in the future when commercial satellites will offer so many market opportunities they will become the equivalent of an iPhone, with dozens of applications from the same platform.
Meanwhile, although he is quick to add that oil and gas pipelines provide “the safest way of transporting hydrocarbons,” he said the industry needs a reputational boost — and adding a very effective leak detection technology to its existing tools certainly won’t harm the industry.

Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Cost Increases To $9.3 Billion | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The final cost of Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement project has risen by 13 per cent to $9.3 billion (in source currency) from $8.2 billion but it remains on target for a fourth quarter 2021 in-service date, the company said today.
“We actually came in very close for budget on the vast majority of the project,” Al Monaco, president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call to discuss 2020 fourth quarter and full year results.
The increase in costs results mainly from the company’s revised execution plan related to regulatory and permitting processes in Minnesota, he said. The cost reflects winter construction, further enhancements to industry-leading environmental protections and construction techniques, the extended regulatory and permitting timeframe, higher capitalized interest and COVID-19 protocols, according to Enbridge.  
“We've reiterated to our execution team that environmental protection and safety are the number one priority here and that includes stringent COVID measures,” he said.
Despite the higher cost, the full-cycle return remains attractive and Enbridge is seeing a stronger volume profile and lower interest rates than when it originally was proposed, according to Monaco.
When the Line 3 replacement project has been placed fully into service, a surcharge of US89.5 cents/bbl will be applied for a 10-year period, inclusive of the current interim 20-cent surcharge for the Canadian portion of Line 3. In addition, incremental throughput related to the restored Line 3 capacity will receive an international joint toll charge for each bbl.
If the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) approves Enbridge’s application for Canadian Mainline contracting, the entire Line 3 would be captured as part of that and a provision for inflation is built into the current contract, said Colin Gruending, executive vice-president and chief financial officer. “So I think it depends on our success at the CER and how that capital will be inflated over the next 10 years,” he said.
“After the next 10 years, then we would be looking at whatever regulatory mechanism we had in place to get our appropriate return on capital at that time.”
Enbridge anticipates about $200 million of free cash flow from the project in the fourth quarter of 2021 with volumes and EBITDA ramping up in 2022 supporting significant free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond.
Construction in Minnesota is underway following receipt of all permits and regulatory approvals. “It's still early days but I think so far things are going better than we had hoped for,” said Vern Yu, executive vice-president and president of Liquids Pipelines. The warm weather initially helped the project although it’s changing now, he said.
“We’re welding pipe on seven spreads right now and we’ve got tents erected at each station so we are able to progress work through the winter.” Work also will have to stop for a short period in the second quarter for environmental reasons, Yu pointed out.
Line 5 update
In the fourth quarter, Enbridge initiated legal filings to request the United States District Court dismiss the State of Michigan's attempt to terminate the 1953 easement across the Straits and thereby close the Line 5 dual pipelines located within the easement. The revocation of the easement by the State of Michigan is contrary to federal law and the Canada-US Transit Pipeline Treaty, said the company. In addition, oversight of pipeline safety resides with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) under the federal Pipeline Safety Act, it added.
“The dual lines that cross the Straits are safe and in full compliance with the federal pipeline safety standards that govern them and has been deemed fit for service by PHMSA in June and September of 2020. Enbridge has no intention of shutting down the pipelines based on the State's unspecified allegations and its violation of federal law,” said Enbridge.
Enbridge continues to advance construction related activities on its state-of-the-art tunnel designed to further protect the Great Lakes and make an already safe pipeline safer. On Jan. 29, 2021 the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy issued permits relating to wetlands and submerged lands, along with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits. The company continues to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Public Service Commission on additional permits and regulatory approvals.

Canada U.S. Commons Committee Exploring Latest Cross Border Pipeline Flashpoint | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– The latest pipeline dispute between Canada and the United States is back on the agenda in Ottawa.
Enbridge Inc. vice-president Vern Yu is scheduled to appear Tuesday before a special House of Commons committee exploring Canada-U.S. ties.
Enbridge owns and operates Line 5, a vital cross-border energy link that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has vowed to shut down.
Whitmer is convinced the dual pipeline, which runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, poses too severe a threat to the health of the Great Lakes.
Yu, head of the Calgary company's liquid-pipeline division, has called Whitmer's concerns baseless and says Line 5 remains safe.
Michigan has refused to concede that the state's own experts have concluded there are no clear alternatives to the pipeline, he wrote to the governor in a letter earlier this year.
The state ""fails to acknowledge that Line 5 enables the safe transport of fuel essential to heat homes and provides energy to Michigan, neighbouring U.S. states and Canada's two largest provinces,"" Yu wrote.
""It also fails to account for the significant adverse social and economic impacts that will result from closure.""
Line 5 has emerged as the newest flashpoint in Canada-U.S. relations just two months after President Joe Biden cancelled the Keystone XL expansion project.
Also testifying today are Maryscott Greenwood of the Canadian American Business Council and Mark Agnew and Aaron Henry of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
Prepared remarks by Agnew and Henry indicate the chamber is taking a hard line as part of a concerted ""Team Canada"" approach to opposing Michigan's efforts to shut down the line.
""Revoking the easement and shutting down Line 5 will create significant repercussions for Canada and the U.S. economies,"" Henry, the chamber's senior director of natural resources, says in his opening statement.
Cutting off the pipeline, which moves some 540,000 barrels of fossil fuels a day through Michigan, would cost $65 billion in direct revenue and $28 billion of indirect revenue in annual trade.
It delivers more than half the state's propane demand, supports 29,000 jobs in Sarnia, Ont., alone, and would require 800 rail cars or 2,000 trucks a day to replace its capacity, the statement adds.
“There is no alternative to Line 5, simply because the capacity to absorb the products moved through Line 5 does not exist.''
Andrew Leach, an economist and business professor at the University of Alberta who specializes in the energy sector, said the Line 5 dispute is shaping up as a major sticking point between Canada and the United States.
Keystone XL proved a bilateral irritant throughout President Barack Obama's two terms as president.
Biden's decision prompted a fierce reaction from Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who has promised to take “every legal recourse'' in hopes of recouping the province's multibillion-dollar investment.
Whitmer, meanwhile, is a close ally of Biden who was on his original list of potential running mates before he made her a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee.
“The combination of Gov. Whitmer's connection to the Biden administration, the probably ill-advised opening gambits from Alberta and to some degree Canada, digging their heels in as they did, probably made it more likely that this becomes the next flashpoint,'' Leach said.
The difference between Keystone XL and Line 5, he added, is that the latter is a pre-existing pipeline that has been demonstrating its importance to both countries for nearly 60 years.
“You don't need to do hypotheticals about this,'' Leach said. “It's very clear.”

Brookfield Says It Is Committed To Hostile Inter Pipeline Takeover | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Investment firm Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. said on Thursday it is committed to its C$7.1 billion ($5.65 billion) hostile takeover offer for Inter Pipeline Ltd. despite the pipeline company's board turning down the bid.
The largest individual shareholder in Inter Pipeline said it welcomes the board's ""efforts to market test the offer against other take-private proposals,"" adding that its offer is in the best interest of the Canadian company's shareholders.
Inter Pipeline on Tuesday asked its shareholders to reject the offer, saying it “significantly undervalues"" the oil and gas transportation company.
Brookfield last month launched a hostile bid with the same C$16.50 per share offer that Inter Pipeline had previously rejected as inadequate.
The investment company had also said it was willing to raise its offer to as much as C$18.25 per share if the pipeline company comes to the negotiating table, but Inter turned it down and later launched a strategic review of options, which could include a ""corporate transaction.”
Inter Pipeline, which expects a superior offer or other alternatives to emerge, also previously said it is looking for a partner for its C$4 billion Heartland Petrochemical Complex in Alberta that is due to start operating early next year.

Tidewater To Focus On ‘Deleveraging’ | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd.’s focus over the next 12 months is to employ the related cash flow generated from its 2019 large, completed capital projects and Prince George Refinery (PGR), as well as proceeds from the Pioneer transaction, towards deleveraging.
The target net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 3.0 – 3.5 times. To date, Tidewater has not committed to a significant capital program in 2021, however it continues to evaluate smaller capital projects with the potential to generate returns in excess of 50 per cent.
During 2019, Tidewater commissioned three of the largest capital projects in its history: the Pioneer Pipeline, Pipestone Gas Plant and Pipestone Gas Storage Facility. The company’s focus in 2020 was on small-scale optimization and commissioning projects.
Tidewater's 300 bbl/day canola co-processing project at PGR is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2021 which will produce both renewable diesel and gasoline. Total capital for the project is approximately $10 million and includes significant support from the B.C. government.
Revenue for 2020 climbed to $979.41 million from $692.27 million. Net loss was $33.77 million compared to $6.75 million. Distributable cash flow was $47.17 million for 2020, down from $56.37 million the previous year.
Prince George Refinery
PGR is a 12,000 bbl/day light oil refinery that predominantly produces low sulphur diesel and gasoline to supply the greater Prince George region. PGR has significant on-site storage capacity of greater than one million bbl and flexible logistics, with pipeline, rail and truck connectivity in place. The Prince George region is generally in short supply of refined products and the refinery's location within the region makes it a critical piece of infrastructure with a significant logistical advantage to address demand in northern British Columbia.
PGR has significant advantages given its location as the Prince George market faces logistical and economic challenges given transport costs and the lack of offloading facilities in the area. Additionally, the refinery supplies the majority of the regional demand, which is comprised of major local industries such as forestry, mining and oil and gas.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, total throughput exceeded the refinery's nameplate capacity at approximately 12,187 bbl/day, consistent with the third quarter of 2020.
Tidewater's refining margins are largely driven by commodity prices, particularly the cost of crude feedstock and other raw materials, along with market prices for refined products. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Tidewater realized improved margins on diesel as a result of increased pricing which was partially offset by lower demand due to the implementation of new COVID-19 restrictions in December. Gasoline prices and volumes decreased slightly quarter over quarter as a result of seasonal demand. Overall, margins at the refinery increased approximately 10 per cent from the third quarter as a result of strong diesel pricing.
Tidewater is encouraged by the resilience of the PGR asset in an unprecedented time with full-year crack spreads holding steady around $55/bbl. This demonstrates the refinery's long-term value in servicing the markets in which it operates.
Tidewater is progressing on its Canola co-processing project and expects it to be online in late 2021. The project is supported by the B.C. government and will produce both renewable gasoline and renewable diesel.
The company continues to evaluate various renewable initiatives at PGR. These include expanding existing hydrogen assets, renewable hydrogen and the potential for a large-scale renewable diesel project with current support from the provincial government. Renewable diesel results in an approximate 80 – 90 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to regular conventional diesel and performs better in colder temperatures as compared to biodiesel, said the company.
Tidewater is also pursuing numerous low capital and high rate of return debottleneck and optimization opportunities within its downstream business unit.
Pipestone Gas Plant
The Pipestone Gas Plant is designed to process approximately 100 mmcf/d of sour natural gas. This asset includes two acid gas injection wells, a saltwater disposal well, and sales gas pipelines directly connected to the Pipestone Gas Storage Facility, as well as the Alliance and TC Energy Corporation pipeline systems. The facility is also pipeline connected to Pembina for the C2+ and C5+ liquid streams.
The Pipestone Gas Plant processed an average volume of 72 mmcf/day in the fourth quarter of 2020 which is consistent with the third quarter of 2020. Facility availability for the quarter averaged 77 per cent which was impacted by an unplanned outage in early October. The Pipestone Gas Plant is fully contracted with over 80 per cent committed on take-or-pay arrangements.
Pioneer Pipeline
The Pioneer Pipeline is currently jointly owned and operated by Tidewater and TransAlta Corporation. The asset is held for sale, subject to closing of the Pioneer transaction which is subject to customary conditions in a transaction of this nature including regulatory approvals by the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) and the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). Following the execution of the purchase and sale agreement, the parties filed applications for regulatory approval. Regulatory approval is anticipated in the second quarter of 2021 and Tidewater remains proactive in its efforts to complete the transaction on a timely basis.
Upon the closing of the Pioneer transaction, the Pioneer Pipeline will be integrated into NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.'s (NGTL) and ATCO's Alberta integrated natural gas transmission systems to provide reliable natural gas supply to TransAlta's power generating units at Sundance and Keephills.
Tidewater has entered into a project and expenditure authorization agreement with NGTL at the Rat Creek West Meter Station for the natural gas liquids extraction service (OS-Ext) that will allow Tidewater to extract higher value liquids from the natural gas stream prior to delivery of natural gas at the TransAlta facilities. Tidewater does not expect any facility modifications or capital expenditures to be required to implement this service. It is expected that with this service Tidewater will be able to materially increase throughput subject to market conditions. It is anticipated that this service will commence concurrent with the close of the Pioneer Transaction.
Brazeau River Complex and fractionation facility
The BRC is a core asset for Tidewater, offering a full suite of services to producers, including C2, C3, C4 and C5 pipeline connections, NGL fractionation capacity, sweet and sour deep-cut gas processing capability, truck loading and offloading facilities, natural gas storage facilities and two natural gas egress solutions given the BRC's connection to the NGTL system and the Pioneer Pipeline.
Throughput at the BRC for the fourth quarter of 2020 was in-line with the previous quarter. Overall supply volumes at the fractionation facility decreased approximately 450 bbl/day in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the prior quarter largely driven by slightly lower gas supply and stable truck in volumes.
Due to the recent improvement in AECO gas prices, the company continues to see increased activity in the Deep Basin area near the BRC, which has led to the tie-in of additional raw gas volumes to the BRC from a mid-sized producer which came online in the fourth quarter of 2020, and strong production volumes amongst the existing customer base. Tidewater works diligently with producers to improve netbacks by fully utilizing the BRC's facilities.
Natural gas storage
Tidewater operates natural gas storage reservoirs at three different facilities: Dimsdale Paddy A (Pipestone Gas Storage Facility), Brazeau Nisku F, and Brazeau Nisku A. The Pipestone Gas Storage Facility and Brazeau Nisku A are owned through joint ventures with a private Canadian entity and are accounted for as equity investments.
After a successful summer season with expanded injection capabilities, the Pipestone Storage Facility exited October with record inventories in the ground. Similarly, both Brazeau Nisku A and Brazeau Nisku F storage pools continued to build inventories into October while continuing to meet the Pioneer Pipeline delivery obligations and realizing liquids value benefit through cycling.
The Alberta natural gas market in the fourth quarter was characterized by relatively low price volatility. While there was early price strength in the second half of October that allowed the facilities to begin withdrawal activity early, mild weather generally kept prices rangebound between C$1.90 - $2.50/GJ with levels trending lower through November and December.
The facilities continued to perform well in the period as Tidewater moved into withdrawal mode. A well reactivation project at Brazeau Nisku A performed in the fourth quarter further increased reservoir deliverability.
The Pipestone gas storage facility is fully contracted with take-or-pay contracts spanning up to eight-years with multiple investment grade counterparties. The facility represents a significant contribution to Tidewater's fee-for-service gas storage business and offers producers at the Pipestone Gas Plant significant optionality where the plant has three egress solutions including connections to the TC Energy and Alliance systems and gas storage.

Toews Says Final Bill On Defunct Keystone XL Not 'Materially' Above $1.3B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) –– Alberta’s finance minister says taxpayers won't be on the hook for much more beyond $1.3 billion already committed to the defunct Keystone XL pipeline.
“Our total exposure is just under $1.3 billion. It's not expected to increase materially,'' Travis Toews said Tuesday, responding to questions from Opposition NDP finance critic Shannon Phillips during committee deliberations on the 2021-22 budget.
The meeting also learned that while the $1.3-billion loss was not included in the budget's bottom line, it is being factored into government talking points.
The NDP has been asking for financial details ever since Premier Jason Kenney and his United Conservative government, in early 2020, committed $1.5 billion in direct financing and $6 billion more in loan guarantees to pipeline operator TC Energy Corporation for the cross-border Keystone XL expansion project.
KXL was to take more Alberta oil across the United States and down to ports and refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas.
Around that time, the project faced multiple court challenges. The emerging U.S. Democratic party candidate, now President Joe Biden, promised in his election campaign to cancel it.
Biden did so in January on his first day in office, saying more product from Alberta’s oilsands does not mesh with his larger goal of combating climate change.
Alberta's 2021-22 budget, introduced by Toews Feb. 25, did not factor the $1.3 billion KXL expenditure into its bottom line.
Toews said it will be when final accounting is done for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31. Officials have said it was not accounted for because the government is still trying to recoup the money.
On Monday, Kenney told the house during question period that his government will sue the U.S. government to recoup the money under legacy rules tied to the old North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
NAFTA has been replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, but investors can still sue under NAFTA until the middle of 2023.
“The U.S. administration slapped this country in the face by vetoing that project. We're going to sue them under NAFTA,'' said Kenney.
Also Monday, Kenney told a news conference that capital commitment in the current fiscal year is $10 billion. He called it “the largest infrastructure budget to build things in the history of Alberta.''
Phillips challenged Kenney's announcement. She noted that the capital spend under the NDP government three years ago was $9 billion, while this year's capital spend will be $8.2 billion.
“How is 8.2 more than 9?'' asked Phillips.
Toews said the government is including the $1.3 billion in KXL spending.
“That was an investment that actually did provide thousands of jobs,'' said Toews.
Phillips replied: “So ... the largest capital plan in Alberta history includes money that is spent on people not building capital – because KXL was cancelled.''
The meeting was lit by sparks of tension between governing UCP committee members and the NDP.
Chair Dave Hanson twice rejected UCP motions to derail Phillips’s KXL questions on the grounds that they did not relate to the budget and were repetitive.
At one point, UCP member Shane Getson offered to explain to Phillips how pipeline construction works.
Hanson directed Getson to apologize, which he did.

Public Invited To Comment On Trans Mountain Request To File Names Of Insurers On Confidential Basis | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is seeking public comments on whether Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC should be allowed to file the names of its insurers on a confidential basis for 2021 and for all future filings.
In a letter to Trans Mountain, the CER said it is seeking comments related to the company’s request concerning the current operating Trans Mountain pipeline, and not in relation to the expansion project. Comments can be filed by 4 p.m. (Mountain) March 22, 2021 and Trans Mountain must file reply comments by 4 p.m. March 25, 2021.
In its request to the CER, Trans Mountain cited pressure on its insurers from environmental activists that ultimately could mean higher tolls for shippers.
All companies must file annual updates to their financial resources plans by April 30 of each year. If insurance is maintained as part of a company’s plan, the annual filing must include an updated certificate of insurance, which would include the names of the insurance providers, the amount of insurance coverage applicable to each provider, and the providers’ respective A.M. Best Ratings. Trans Mountain has requested confidential treatment of the names of its insurers for 2021 and for all future filings.
The commission said it will consider all comments filed during this comment process, as well as the comments in opposition to the request for a confidential filing already submitted by Robyn Allan and Stand.earth, in its determination of the matter.
Allan, a former president and chief executive officer of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) and a long-time opponent of the Trans Mountain expansion, told the CER that granting Trans Mountain’s request will do nothing to increase the number of insurers willing to provide coverage or reduce premiums.

Inter Pipeline Board Recommends Shareholders Reject Brookfield’s Hostile Bid | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Inter Pipeline Ltd.’s board of directors has unanimously determined that Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.'s hostile takeover bid is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders.
“The board's determination followed careful consideration, including advice from its financial and legal advisors, and the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors,” said the company.
The board believes the hostile bid significantly undervalues Inter Pipeline's standalone plan and unanimously recommends that shareholders reject the hostile bid and not tender their common shares.
""Our business continues to perform strongly and we continue to expect that our nearly completed Heartland Petrochemical Complex, the largest growth project in our history, will deliver a step-change in cash flow starting next year,"" said Margaret McKenzie, chair of the special committee. ""We have launched a comprehensive strategic review process focused on maximizing value for shareholders and we believe superior offers or other alternatives may emerge.""
TD Securities has been retained by Inter Pipeline and J.P. Morgan has been retained by the special committee to assist in the strategic review. Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP and Dentons Canada LLP are acting as legal advisors to Inter Pipeline, its board of directors and the special committee. Kingsdale Advisors is engaged as strategic shareholder advisor and Longview Communications as communications advisor to the company.

Enhance Energy Says 1 Million Tonnes Of CO2 Captured And Sequestered | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Enhance Energy Inc. says it has captured and sequestered one million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
“That is one million tonnes of CO2 that would otherwise have gone into the atmosphere, but instead was captured, compressed, and transported to a mature oilfield in Clive, Alta., where it was sequestered,” said the company.
This rate of carbon mitigation has the equivalent emissions impact of taking approximately 350,000 cars off the road, the company added.
""There's no question that the world is moving toward a more sustainable path,” said Kevin Jabusch, Enhance President and CEO. ""At Enhance we are part of the solution. We can continue to produce the energy we need to power our homes, our vehicles, and the economy, and we can do it in a less carbon intensive way. We are sequestering CO2 and we are using it to help produce some of the lowest cost lowest carbon energy on the planet. All Albertans can be proud of this work.""
Now 10 years into their efforts, Enhance received funding from the provincial and federal governments to move this project forward and support the critical infrastructure to allow for future growth.
The CO2 is captured from both the NWR Sturgeon Refinery and the Nutrien fertilizer facility located in the Alberta Industrial Heartland, and then is transported via the Alberta Carbon Trunkline (ACTL) to the mature oilfield near the town of Clive in central Alberta. Enhance Energy founded the ACTL project over a decade ago and the ACTL pipeline is now owned and operated by Wolf Midstream.
""This is an amazing accomplishment in a short period of time — an accomplishment that demonstrates the ACTL system is a reliable solution for large-scale CO2 emissions reduction,” said Jeff Pearson, president of the carbon business unit of Wolf Midstream. “The pipeline has excess capacity and will serve as the backbone for a larger CO2 pipeline network. Emitters can utilize this network to safely send CO2 down the line to sequestration, keeping their emissions out of the atmosphere.""
The Clive CCUS project reached full commercial operation in mid-2020, and since then more than one million tonnes of carbon has been returned deep underground.

Expansion Proposed For Foothills South B.C. Pipeline System | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Foothills Pipe Lines (South B.C.) Ltd. is seeking Canada Energy Regulator (CER) approval for a $402 million project to increase capacity on the Foothills South B.C. (Zone 8) system to meet existing and incremental contractual obligations.
The project is underpinned by approximately 162 terajoules/d of incremental Firm Transportation – Delivery (FT-D) service on the Foothills South B.C. system from the Alberta-B.C border to the Kingsgate border meter station.
The targeted in-service date is Nov. 1, 2023.
Foothills, a wholly owned subsidiary of operator TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL), is requesting a decision from the CER in October 2021. The schedule calls for a construction start in July 2022 and project completion in October 2023.
The project consists of a single loop of 1219 millimetre (48-inch) outside diameter natural gas pipeline that will loop the existing British Columbia Mainline and the Foothills South B.C. Pipeline (Elko section) along with an expansion of the meter station.
The proposed Elko section consists of approximately 32 kilometres of 48-inch pipeline, with a maximum operating pressure of 8690 kPa. It will be built approximately 17 kilometres east of Fernie, between 26-C/82-G-10 and b-84-D/82-G-7. The section is contiguous with existing disturbance for 76 per cent of its length.
The segment route will cross federal Crown freehold land (Dominion Coal Block parcel 82) for 90 per cent (28 kilometres) of the distance with eight per cent crossing private freehold land and two per cent, provincial Crown land.
Foothills anticipates acquisition of new land and temporary work space will be required for the project. Temporary worker accommodation (one or more camps) may be required or Foothills may use local accommodations within nearby communities (e.g. Sparwood and Fernie or both). 
Foothills in its application says it is in negotiations with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) for a new easement across the lands which generally will run parallel, and adjacent, to the existing Foothills pipelines that run through the Coal Block. The pipelines were constructed in 1960 (British Columbia Mainline) and in 1981 (Foothills South B.C Pipeline).
As part of the project, Foothills plans to expand the capacity of existing metering facilities by replacing 14 orifice-meter plates with larger diameter plates within the existing meter station site at b-05-B/82-F-1. The maximum operating pressure of the Kingsgate meter station will remain at 6280 kPa after the replacement of the orifice plates.
To meet the required in-service date, Foothills has asked the CER to make a determination as early as possible pursuant to section 82 of the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) as to whether the proposed Elko section is likely to cause significant adverse environment effect to federal land.
Access preparation for the Elko section is planned to start in July 2022 with a start to early clearing of the Elko Section in August 2022 is critical for mainline construction to start in July 2023 so that Foothills can meet the required commercial in-service date.
During the period from the beginning of July to the end of November in 2022, Foothills plans to prepare the right-of-way (ROW).
Foothills also is investigating options for a camp to support steep slope construction. Due to the presence of a steep slope on the western side of the Flathead ridge, an engineered system, to be removed after final clean-up, will be used to assist in the installation of pipe along that section.
The proposed route for the Elko section crosses a total of 30 watercourses (26 fish-bearing and four non fish-bearing), and 13 non-classified drainages. The proposed primary pipeline crossing method for all watercourses is an isolated open-cut if water is present or a dry open-cut if the watercourse is dry or frozen at the time of construction. The proposed contingency crossing method is trenchless.
Foothills said it anticipates using one or both of open-cut or shallow-bore construction techniques for all third-party pipeline, road, and utility crossings.

Canada Looking At All Options To Keep Line 5 Pipeline Operating | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Canada will take whatever measures are needed to keep the Line 5 oil pipeline open, Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan said on Thursday, as the deadline for a shutdown order from the U.S. state of Michigan looms.
Michigan last November ordered pipeline owner Enbridge Inc. to shut down Line 5, which ships 540,000 bbls/d of crude oil and propane from Canada, in May because of concerns the 68-year-old pipeline could leak into the Great Lakes.
O'Regan's comments came after Michael Grant, assistant deputy minister for the Americas at the Canadian foreign ministry, said on Tuesday that Canada could turn to the Transit Pipelines Treaty of 1977, which provides for the unimpeded flow of petroleum products in pipelines linking the two nations.
""We are preparing to invoke whatever measures we need to in order to make sure Line 5 remains operational,"" O'Regan told a parliamentary committee. He declined to comment specifically on the government's legal strategy.
O'Regan, who spoke with U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Wednesday, said he was confident Enbridge and Michigan would be able to come to an agreement, but the Canadian government was fighting ""on every front"" for Line 5.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government was criticized by oil-producing provinces and the energy industry for failing to safeguard KXL, and is under pressure to ensure Line 5 does not also get shut down.
""It's vital to Canadian energy security and to America's. We raised Line 5 directly with the president, and we are looking at all our options,"" O'Regan said.
Unlike KXL, which was under construction when its permit was revoked, Line 5 is currently in service.
Enbridge is fighting the shutdown order in federal court and has proposed building an underwater tunnel to house the pipeline where it runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes.

Value Of Existing Energy Pipelines Grows As ESG Targets Block New Projects | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Existing energy pipelines in North America are becoming increasingly valuable because investor focus on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues is making it more difficult to finance new infrastructure, midstream industry executives said on Wednesday.
The ""tobaccofication"" of the energy industry in recent years has led to less money flowing to the midstream sector as investors and the public increasingly focus ESG investments, Peter Bowden, global head of energy investment banking at Jefferies, told IHS Markit's CERAWeek conference.
""It has become much more difficult to finance these projects,"" Bowden said, referencing midstream projects. ""In terms of equity capital the markets are severely depressed.""
From 2013 to 2015, average equity issuance per year for midstream was $25 billion, but in the three years through 2020, it averaged just $1 billion yearly, he added.
New oil and gas pipeline projects are a ""huge leap,"" Al Monaco, chief executive of Enbridge Inc. said at the conference, and companies are instead prioritizing expansions, repurposing, and extensions of existing assets.
""The value of the pipe we have in the ground is increasing. We have not seen that reflected yet in equity prices but it's got to get there because you simply cannot replicate [it],"" Monaco said.
Enbridge's Line 3 replacement project, which will ship more oilsands crude from Alberta to the U.S. Midwest, has faced years of regulatory delays and legal challenges. Rival TC Energy Corporation’s Keystone XL oil pipeline was blocked earlier this year when U.S. President Joe Biden revoked its permit.
Alan Armstrong, CEO of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based, pipeline operator Williams Companies Inc., said natural gas infrastructure is also being impacted, even though it should play a role in the energy transition. Natural gas is abundant in the United States and has lower carbon emissions than coal.
Both Armstrong and Monaco said existing infrastructure would be key in transporting renewable fuels and clean energy sources like hydrogen in future.

"Exports To Drive U.S. Natural Gas Demand Growth, But Pipelines Needed | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
 (Reuters) — U.S. domestic consumption of natural gas will peak around 2030 but rising pipeline and LNG exports should keep demand for the fuel growing through 2050, Matthew Palmer, senior director at IHS Markit, said on Wednesday.
Moving that gas from the states where it is produced to places where it can be consumed or exported, however, will become increasingly challenging, Palmer said at IHS Markit's CERAWeek conference.
He said IHS Markit does not expect any new big interstate gas pipes to be built after the $5.8 billion-$6 billion Mountain Valley pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia enters service, expected earliest by the end of the year.  
""The challenges in the court system and the expense of building these infrastructure projects have made them very difficult to proceed with,"" Palmer said.
Mountain Valley is one of several U.S. pipelines delayed in recent years by regulatory and legal fights with states and environmental groups that found problems with permits issued by the Trump administration.
""If we don't create the right infrastructure across the United States, we're basically telling the world that they can't have access to our natural gas,"" Octávio Simões, chief executive of U.S. liquefied natural gas company Tellurian Inc. said on a CERAWeek panel.
""People need energy now and the only way to lower the global carbon footprint is with gas,"" Simões said, noting the United States lowered its carbon emissions when the power sector started burning more low-cost gas and less coal.
However, investor focus on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues is making it more difficult to finance new pipelines in North America, midstream industry executives also said at the conference.

"Natural Gas Can Help Solve Climate Change, Industry Reminds Policymakers | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — The energy industry wants policymakers to remember that natural gas can and should be part of the solution in solving climate change, executives said at a conference on Tuesday.
""The most important thing to continue to impress upon the policymakers is natural gas can and should be a big part of the climate change solutions,"" Michele Harradence, SVP and chief operations officer gas transmission and midstream at Enbridge Inc., said at IHS Markit's CERAWeek.
She noted gas has already ""done a lot to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in North America. It is an excellent compliment to renewable energy and provides low cost reliable backup needed to support growth of renewable infrastructure.""
In the United States, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels fell in 2020 to its lowest since 1983 as coal-fired power plants retired and were replaced by gas-fired generators and renewable electric sources, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Harradence noted that building more gas infrastructure does not lock in emissions over the long term since “we can blend hydrogen and renewable natural gas into the gas stream and that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
Another speaker on the CERAWeek Gas & The Decarbonization Agenda panel, Andy Calitz, deputy secretary-general of the International Gas Union (IGU) trade group, said one of the most important things global major economic powers could do is adopt a carbon tax.
Calitz said the “amazingly cold winter in the northern hemisphere ... will impress upon governments ... that a careful balance needs to be struck between energy security and climate risk ... because the stakes are so enormously high.”
Calitz and other executives on the panel noted gas can provide that energy security and help reduce carbon emissions from burning other fossil fuels like coal and oil.

Finishing LNG Canada On Budget A Challenge Facing The Project's CEO | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Finishing the $17 billion LNG Canada plant in Kitimat and the associated $6.6 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline on time and on budget promises to be one of the challenges facing LNG Canada’s CEO, Peter Zebedee, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In July 2019, Zebedee took over from Andy Calitz, the Royal Dutch Shell plc executive who had been seconded to shepherd the LNG Canada project to the starting line. It is Zebedee’s job to get the project across the finish line.
Like so many projects and businesses, the project hit a speed bump in 2020, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health restrictions on workplaces resulted in both the LNG construction project in Kitimat and the Coastal GasLink pipeline having to temporarily shrink their work forces.
In an interview with BIV News, Zebedee said LNG Canada and its engineering, procurement and construction contractor, JGC Fluor, are managing the interruption for the LNG project in Kitimat.
“We work really hard to offset the impacts of COVID, both in terms of costs and schedule, along with our EPC contractor JGC Fluor,” Zebedee said. “At this point in time, I’d say we are a single digit percentage point behind.
“We continue to hit key construction milestones, despite the unforeseen challenges that we’ve seen coming out of COVID,” he said. “We are currently sitting at about 1,200 people on-site. We’ve had to manage that through the provincial health orders and we’ll be ramping up to about 3,000 workers by the end of the first quarter.”
But the associated Coastal GasLink pipeline project, which will supply LNG Canada with natural gas, may face delays and cost increases.
There are basically three components to the $40 billion LNG project. The Kitimat LNG facility was estimated to cost $17 billion to $18 billion, and CGL was estimated to cost $6.6 billion. The balance represents upstream investments in natural gas wells, processing plants and other infrastructure.
In its most recent fourth quarter financials, TC Energy Corporation, which is building the CGL pipeline, warned the project is likely to suffer delays and “significant” cost increases.
“Like any other relationship, sometimes you disagree on issues,” Zebedee said. “I must say, I was disappointed by…TC’s messaging last week.
“My expectation, and the expectation of our partners, is that they continue to progress the project on cost and schedule and ensure that the costs on the pipeline project are incurred in a reasonable and prudent manner. And that is the subject of an ongoing dialogue that we have with Coastal GasLink.”
As for the LNG project in Kitimat, milestones in 2020 included the opening of the Cedar Valley Lodge in Kitimat, which will house up to 4,500 workers. A large LNG storage tank is currently under construction.
LNG Canada had two outbreaks of COVID-19 among workers, in November and in December.
“Both were fully contained without any resultant spread into the community,” Zebedee said.
The company recently implemented a rapid testing process for all workers that come to the site.
In 2021, the company expects to start receiving the first of hundreds of modules being built in Asia.
“We expect to land our first module from overseas in Kitimat in the second half of this year,” Zebedee said.
To date, LNG Canada has awarded close to $3 billion worth of contracts to B.C. businesses, including First Nations contractors.

"TC Energy, Ex-Columbia Pipeline Execs Must Face Lawsuit Over $10 Billion Deal | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) –– TC Energy Corporation and two former Columbia Pipeline Group Inc. executives must defend against a lawsuit claiming the companies' $10 billion merger in 2016 shortchanged Columbia investors, a Delaware judge ruled on Monday.
Vice Chancellor Travis Laster of the Delaware Chancery Court refused to dismiss the lawsuit by former Columbia shareholders, led by the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi.
Former Columbia chief executive Robert Skaggs and chief financial officer Stephen Smith were accused of engineering a spin-off of Columbia from NiSource Inc., and then selling Columbia to TC Energy at a lowball price to obtain lucrative change-of-control payments, known as golden parachutes.
Laster said it was reasonable to infer that Skaggs and Smith breached their duty of loyalty to Columbia by agreeing to sell their company for $25.50 per share, below the $26 per share proposed by TC Energy.
Laster also said the company could be liable for aiding and abetting that breach.
The defendants could face damages for the difference between the sale price and what Columbia might have fetched had it held out for a higher price.
A lawyer for TC Energy, Skaggs and Smith declined to comment.
The investor lawsuit is the fourth over the sale of Columbia, which created one of North America's largest regulated natural gas transmission businesses.
Two of those lawsuits were dismissed in the early stages. In the third, known as an appraisal case, Laster found that the $25.50 per share takeover price was fair.
The defendants said that decision should have precluded the fourth lawsuit, but Laster said the legal questions and standards were different.

Baker Hughes Discloses SEC Probe Over Projects Affected By U.S. Sanctions | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) –– Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is conducting an investigation into the company's sale of products in projects that were impacted by U.S. sanctions.
Baker was notified in December of the SEC's formal investigation into its records and internal controls related with sales at the impacted projects, the company disclosed in its annual regulatory filing on Thursday.
The Houston-based company added that it is providing the information sought by the SEC.
Baker Hughes did not specify the exact details of the investigation or which projects it was focused on. Reuters had reported on Thursday that Baker Hughes and 17 other firms recently quit work on Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and avoided being sanctioned for it.
The company said it has also initiated a review with the assistance of external legal counsel regarding the company's internal controls and compliance related to U.S. sanctions requirements.
Baker said since the SEC investigation and the company’s internal review are ongoing, it could not anticipate the timing, outcome or impact of the investigation or review.

Pembina Eyeing Larger Expansion Of Prince Rupert Propane Export Terminal | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
With its first propane export terminal set to come into service near the end of the first quarter of 2021, Pembina Pipeline Corporation says it is evaluating its deferred expansion project for the Prince Rupert Terminal.
The company is now considering a larger expansion of the 25,000 bbl/d facility, which would accommodate larger vessels and improve economies of scale and lower per-unit operating costs, Mick Dilger, Pembina president and chief executive officer, said today in a conference call to discuss 2020 fourth quarter and year results.
The Prince Rupert Terminal will primarily source propane from the company's Redwater Complex. Marine, rail, sphere, and mechanical construction is nearing completion, and electrical construction and commissioning activities are in progress. The project has a capital budget of $250 million and is over budget, said Pembina.
The Phase VIII and Phase IX expansions of the Peace Pipeline remain deferred and Pembina is using the time to optimize and reduce costs, just at did for Phase VII which it also had deferred and reactivated late last year, said Dilger. The initial contracts supporting the projects are still in place and there are ongoing negotiations for incremental capacity.
Pembina expects to make a decision in the second half of 2021 to re-activate all three projects, he said.  “Taken together they are indicative of the growth opportunities afforded by Pembina's industry-leading footprint.”  
Pembina also is working on an extensive portfolio of unsecured opportunities which are accretive and collectively comprise more than $4 billion of potential capital investment, including brownfield and greenfield projects. “Momentum with customers behind these opportunities continues to build and we are confident of a strong rate of conversion into the secured project bucket,” Dilger told analysts.
Construction of the Hythe Developments project, consisting of natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure in the Pipestone Montney region, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The project is awaiting a third-party tie-in and is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2021.
The company posted a loss of $1.22 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2020, compared to a profit of $150 million in the 2019 quarter and a loss of $316 million for the year versus a profit of $1.51 billion the previous year.
Earnings in both periods were negatively affected by a total of $1.6 billion of non-cash after-tax impairments. Those include the indefinite suspension of the integrated propane dehydration (PDH) plant and polypropylene upgrading facility, a joint venture with Petrochemical Industries Company K.S.C. as well as investments in the Ruby pipeline and Jordan Cove in the United States. Both periods were also negatively affected by higher unrealized losses on commodity-related derivatives.
Pembina reported record adjusted EBITDA of $866 million for the fourth quarter (2019-$787 million) and record full year adjusted EBITDA of $3.28 billion (2019-$3.06 billion) representing a 10 per cent and seven per cent increases, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year which were restated.
Fourth quarter and annual adjusted EBITDA were positively affected by contributions from the assets acquired in the Kinder acquisition, new assets placed into service in the pipelines and facilities division and higher deferred revenue recognized on the Peace Pipeline system, partially offset by lower margins on crude oil sales and a lower contribution from the Alliance pipeline due to a narrower AECO-Chicago natural gas price differential.
Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $766 million (2019-$728 million) and $2.25 billion (2019-$2.53 billion) for the year. 
Fourth quarter capital spending was $161 million, while capital expenditures for the year were $1.03 billion.
Total volumes of 3.61 million boe/d for the fourth quarter and 3.5 million boe/d for the full year represent approximately one per cent increases over the same periods in the prior year. Positive contributions from assets acquired in the Kinder acquisition and new assets coming into service were partially offset by lower interruptible volumes on certain Pipelines assets, as a result of a lower commodity price environment, and lower volumes in certain facilities assets due to lower supply volumes, scheduled turnarounds and COVID-19 related factors.
Facilities 
During the fourth quarter, Pembina completed the start up of new fractionation and terminalling facilities at the Empress NGL Extraction Facility with the project placed into service on time and on budget. These new assets add approximately 30,000 bbls/d of propane-plus fractionation capacity and enable Pembina to optimize propane marketing from the facility between eastern and western markets.
The company also completed the start up of Duvernay III, which includes a 100 mmcf/d sweet gas, shallow cut processing train, 20,000 bbls/d of inlet condensate stabilization and other associated infrastructure. The project was placed into service on time and under budget.
Cochin Pipeline 
Following an open season on the Cochin condensate import pipeline which closed Feb. 18, 2021, Pembina’s first step is evaluating its existing capacity and seeing if it can be optimized within the existing infrastructure, said Jason Wiun, senior vice-president and chief operating officer, pipelines.
With the move of all the operations to its control centre in Edmonton, Pembina was able to find an additional 15,000 bbls/d of capacity on the line that it hadn’t expected and is continuing to look for more, he said. “For our first step, we're really just looking to optimize the way the system is operated and see how much we can wring out of it from that perspective.”
Pembina thinks there is still demand for condensate in the market with room for both expanded capacity on Cochin and incremental growth expected in Canada as Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement and Trans Mountain pipelines come into service, said Wiun.  
Peace Pipeline Lines VI, VIII and IX are designed to bring domestic condensate to market, he said. “We know that product will clear because it has to, and when we think about the basin, as a whole, our shippers on Cochin are the consumers of the product.”
Pembina believes that Enbridge’s Southern Lights condensate pipeline is the swing volume and that it will swing based on what happens on Cochin and what is captured domestically on Peace, Wiun added.

"Alberta 2021 Budget: Keystone XL ‘Exposure’ Estimated At $1.28B To February, Says Alberta Government | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The Alberta government says it is working with TC Energy Corporation “to explore all options” to advance the Keystone XL project and is “strongly encouraging the Government of Canada to do the same,” the province said in budget documents released this afternoon.
“If KXL does not proceed, the Alberta government will explore all options to recoup the investment. Budget 2021 does not include any provisions for expense which may be incurred in that pursuit,” it said. Provincial officials were pressed on this, but no details were released, other than what was contained in the budget documents.
On Jan. 20, 2021, the presidential permit for the KXL border crossing was revoked by the U.S. administration. In response, TC Energy issued work suspension notifications to all KXL U.S. contactors.
The estimated exposure to the Alberta government from the financial commitment, as of February 2021, is as follows, in Canadian dollars:

Equity payment: $384 million;
Estimate of the loan guaranteed by the Alberta government: $892 million;
Total forecasted exposure to February 2021: $1.276 billion.

“Alberta has experienced first-hand the devastating impacts of insufficient market access,” the province said.
In late 2018, for example, Alberta ran out of pipeline capacity, resulting in a record discount between Canada’s heavy oil relative to U.S. light crude, noted the province.
The government imposed a mandatory production curtailment policy to protect the value of the resource and ensure the long-term viability of the industry.
“As producers slashed capital spending and production, Alberta’s already fragile economy stagnated in 2019,” budget documents stated. “With this backdrop, the government made a strategic investment in Keystone XL (KXL) to finally secure long-term market access for the energy industry and protect the value of Alberta’s resources and the economy.
“With a capacity of 830,000 [bbls/d], the pipeline would have provided the country with access to the U.S. Gulf Coast, one of the largest refinery centers in the world designed to process heavy crude. It was also a step toward climate action and North American energy security.
“With a commitment to net zero emissions, the pipeline would have helped Canada replace declining heavy oil production from Mexico and Venezuela and reduce reliance on OPEC crudes in the U.S. market.”
