"NGTL Volume Restrictions Pinch Station 2 Prices, Boost AECO | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Maintenance work on TC Energy Corporation’s NGTL system in recent days has pinched supplies to AECO and flooded Spectra Station 2, resulting in a boost to AECO pricing and weakness at Station 2.
Volumes at Station 2 were fetching 50 cents yesterday (and 70 cents Wednesday). AECO spot prices were at $5.43/GJ on Thursday.
“Yesterday, NGTL, or … TC Energy, announced that starting, I think, yesterday afternoon that there would be some additional restrictions on supplies coming into the upstream transfer portion of the pipe because some of this compression work and other stuff they’re doing up there has ran longer than what they thought and they ran into a couple of unanticipated problems,” said Martin King, senior analyst with RBN Energy, LLC.
“So it may only last a few days. But effectively what that’s done is it’s partially constricted supplies that go downstream towards AECO where AECO is generally priced. So the AECO price has gone up,” he added.
“And because producers that are further upstream of that disruption are trying to get their supplies either onto Alliance or onto Westcoast — they’re all piling onto those pipes — the end result is not enough supply going into AECO and too much supply going into the Station 2 market configurations. So you’ve had a crash at Station 2 but you’ve had an uplift at AECO.”
While that situation has provided a short-term and extra boost to AECO prices, King noted that AECO has been strong in recent weeks as it has been the beneficiary of what’s been occurring in North American and global natural gas markets.
“I think with AECO in the broader sense, it’s been stronger partly just because of an uplift from U.S. gas pricing. The overall market is generally tighter than it was last year and storage in the U.S. is still a little bit below average and you’ve had some decent demand growth this year, as well, through either power generation or industrial demand — just overall demand improvement,” King said.
“And if you really want to kind of stretch things, you could say North America is also feeling some of the heat from international LNG pricing, as well. So it’s a combination of events, and for AECO it’s much more of an uplifting story in 2021 than it certainly was in the previous years.”

"Global Gas Crisis Spilling Over Into Oil Markets, IEA Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) — Shortages of natural gas in Europe and Asia are boosting demand for oil, deepening what was already a sizable supply deficit in crude markets, the International Energy Agency said.
Crude has surged above $80/bbl, the highest in three years, as traders anticipated that record gas prices would stimulate consumption of other fuels, particularly for power generation. That’s already happening and could add about 500,000 bbls/d to oil use on average over the coming six months, the IEA said on Thursday. 
“An acute shortage of natural gas, LNG and coal supplies stemming from the gathering global economic recovery has sparked a precipitous run-up in prices for energy supplies and is triggering a massive switch to oil products,” the IEA said. “Provisional August data already indicates that there is some unseasonably high demand for fuel oil, crude and middle distillates for power plants across a number of countries, including China.”
The latest analysis from the agency shows how the acute shortage of natural gas is spilling over into other markets and the broader economy. The crisis is deepening the current oil-supply deficit, potentially disrupting OPEC’s careful plan to gradually revive idle production. It’s roiling energy-intensive industries and threatens to curb GDP growth and boost inflation.
The IEA raised its estimate for demand growth this year by 300,000 bbls/d to 5.5 million bbls/d, and increased it slightly for 2022 to 3.3 million bbls/d. The effect of oil-gas switching will mostly be felt this quarter and next, the agency said.
The gas crisis isn’t entirely a net positive for oil consumption. The increase in the IEA’s demand estimates was tempered by a weaker outlook for GDP resulting mainly from supply-chain issues and rising energy costs.
“The surge in prices has swept through the entire global energy chain,” the IEA said. “Higher energy prices are also adding to inflationary pressures that, along with power outages, could lead to lower industrial activity and a slowdown in the economic recovery.”
The agency noted that OPEC+ stuck to their plan to boost production by 400,000 bbls/d “despite calls from major consuming countries for a more substantial increase.”
OPEC+ showed no signs of deviating from its plan. Speaking at Russian Energy Week in Moscow, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman reiterated his commitment to a gradual and phased revival of idle supply. The crisis engulfing other energy markets shows what a good job the group has done in regulating oil, he said.
Global oil production will rise by about 2.7 million bbls/d from September to the end of the year as OPEC+ continues to unwind its cuts and U.S. output recovers from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, the IEA said. Even with those additions, the market will be in a supply deficit of about 700,000 bbls/d for the rest of this year, before flipping back into surplus in early 2022, the IEA said.

Vermilion Achieves Responsible Producer Certification Through Equitable Origin | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Vermilion Energy Inc. says it has achieved certification under the EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development (2017) from Equitable Origin for three of its natural gas production sites in west-central Alberta: Granada, Eta Lake and Carrot Creek.
Vermilion is the third producer of natural gas in Canada to have achieved this rigorous certification, which is based on an independent assessment of performance targets within five ESG principles: corporate governance, transparency and ethics; human rights, social impact and community development; Indigenous People’s rights; fair labour and working conditions; and climate change, biodiversity and environment.
“This significant achievement demonstrates our continued commitment to the ESG leadership we have established over the past decade, and helps achieve our goal of providing responsibly produced natural gas to the market,” said Curtis Hicks, president of Vermilion. “As the energy transition progresses, we believe it is essential to demonstrate verified excellence in the environmental and social conditions under which energy has been produced, including natural gas. Independent and stringent certifications such as Equitable Origin provide an important signal about operational quality to stakeholders such as our investors, governments and communities.”
Through its site certification program, Equitable Origin provides credible, independent recognition to energy developers that lead their sector in social and environmental performance. Certification for Vermilion’s sites included an independent third-party assessment conducted in June and July 2021, covering a policies and procedures review, in-person field visits, interviews with workers, contractors and management, and meetings with Indigenous leaders, to verify performance.
“In addition to meeting the standard for certification, which includes a commitment to continuous improvement, Vermilion demonstrated leading practices in several areas, including good faith consultation, land rights, community health and safety, and sustainable community investment,” said Soledad Mills, CEO of Equitable Origin.
Under Vermilion’s first certified natural gas transaction, a portion has been committed to supply a natural gas distributor through Macquarie Energy Canada Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group. This transaction is the result of extensive collaboration between Vermilion and the counterparties, along with Validere and Xpansiv, the global marketplace for ESG commodities, which provides the registry that ensures trust through data transparency.

"Fossil Fuels Make ‘Major Contributions” To Global Energy Mix To 2050, But Crude Demand Falls In All Scenarios: IEA | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Liquid, gaseous and solid fuels of various types will “continue to make a major contribution to the global energy mix” through to 2050 though oil demand, for the first time, shows an eventual decline in all scenarios, says the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook 2021 (WEO-2021) report released this morning.
“If all today’s announced climate pledges are met, the world would still be consuming 75 million oil barrels per day by 2050 — down from around 100 million today — but that plummets to 25 million in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario,” the IEA said in its annual report.
In its outlook, the IEA presented three scenarios — rather than forecasts — of how the world’s energy map may evolve over the next 30 years. This includes the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario from the landmark IEA report published in May, which is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 C.
As well as that scenario, the WEO-2021 explores two other scenarios to gain insights into how the global energy sector may develop over the next three decades — and what the implications would be.
The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) “represents a path based on the energy and climate measures governments have actually put in place to date,” as well as specific policy initiatives that are under development.
“In this scenario, almost all of the net growth in energy demand through 2050 is met by low emissions sources, but that leaves annual emissions still around today’s levels. As a result, global average temperatures are still rising when they hit 2.6-degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in 2100,” the IEA said.
The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) maps out a path in which the net zero emissions pledges announced by governments so far are implemented in time and in full.
“In this scenario, demand for fossil fuels peaks by 2025, and global CO2 emissions fall by 40 per cent by 2050. All sectors see a decline, with the electricity sector delivering by far the largest. The global average temperature rise in 2100 is held to around 2.1-degrees Celsius,” the agency said.
Oil and natural gas demand outlook
In STEPS, the IEA said global oil demand levels off at 104 million bbls/d in the mid-2030s and then declines very slightly to 2050.

Oil use in road transport increases by around six million bbls/d through to 2030, with a particularly sharp rise in 2021, and it increases by close to eight million bbls/d in aviation, shipping and petrochemicals.
In the APS, global oil demand peaks soon after 2025 at 97 million bbls/d and declines to 77 million bbls/d in 2050. Oil use falls by around four million bbls/d in countries with net zero pledges between 2020 and 2030, but that is offset by an eight million bbl/d increase in the rest of the world.
In NZE, oil demand falls to 72 million bbls/d in 2030 and to 24 million bbls/d by 2050. By 2030, 60 per cent of all passenger cars sold globally are electric, and no new ICE passenger cars are sold anywhere after 2035. Oil use as a petrochemical feedstock is the only area to see an increase in demand; in 2050, 55 per cent of all oil consumed globally is for petrochemicals.
Natural gas demand increases in all scenarios over the next five years, with sharp divergences afterwards.
“Many factors affect to what extent, and for how long, natural gas can retain a place in the energy mix when clean energy transitions accelerate, and the outlook is far from uniform across different countries and regions,” the IEA said.
In the STEPS, natural gas demand grows to around 4,500 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2030 (15 per cent higher than in 2020) and to 5,100 bcm in 2050. Use in industry and in the power sector increases to 2050, and natural gas remains the default option for space heating.
In the APS, demand reaches its maximum level soon after 2025 and then declines to 3,850 bcm in 2050. Countries with net zero pledges move away from the use of gas in buildings, and see a near 25 per cent decrease in consumption in the power sector to 2030.
In the NZE, demand drops sharply from 2025 onwards and falls to 1,750 bcm in 2050. By 2050, more than 50 per cent of natural gas consumed is used to produce low-carbon hydrogen, and 70 per cent of gas use is in facilities equipped with CCUS.
Coal faces structural decline in all scenarios

In the STEPS, global coal demand rises slightly to 2025 and then starts a slow decline to 2050 when it is around 25 per cent lower than in 2020. Between 2025 and 2030, total coal demand in China starts to fall and there are large reductions in coal use in advanced economies, mainly as a result of lower demand in the power sector.
In the APS, global coal demand in 2030 is only six per cent lower than in the STEPS because more than 80 per cent of coal demand today comes from countries that do not have net zero pledges or aim only to reduce emissions after 2030. But it declines rapidly after 2030, notably in China, and global demand in 2050 is only half what it was in 2020.
In the NZE, global coal demand drops by 55 per cent to 2030 and by 90 per cent to 2050; in 2050, 80 per cent of the small remaining amount of coal still being used is equipped with CCUS.
Other highlights
In the STEPS, the IEA said the increase in oil demand means oil prices rise to around US$77/bbl in 2030.
Tight oil operators in the U.S. choose to prioritize returns over production growth, and tight oil satisfies much less of the increase in global oil demand than in the past. OPEC production increases by around six million bbls/d to 2030, and Russian production is maintained:
OPEC and Russia together provide 48 per cent of total oil supply in 2030, an increase from 2020 but well below their share during much of the last decade.
Internationally traded volumes of natural gas expand by over 240 bcm between 2020 and 2030.
Australia remains the largest exporter of coal although exports fall by around five per cent to 2030.
In the APS, producer countries with net zero pledges pursue efforts to minimize emissions from oil and gas operations. This increases their production costs relative to other producers as well as their financing costs, but some remain competitive and are able to increase exports of oil and gas when domestic demand declines faster than supply.
“For example, in 2030 the United States exports 3.5 million bbls/d of oil and 200 bcm of natural gas in the APS [compared with 2.5 million bbls/d of oil and 220 bcm of natural gas in the STEPS]. This puts downward pressure on prices, and limits export opportunities for a number of new and emerging producers,” the IEA said.
“OPEC and Russia together provide 48 per cent of total oil supply in 2030. Internationally traded natural gas volumes grow by 160 bcm between 2020 and 2030 [in APS], while the drop in coal demand in countries with net zero pledges means that coal exports fall from all producers.”

"Making The Steel Grade: Tenaris Introduces Canada-Produced Design, Fit For The Montney | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Tenaris SA has tailor engineered, in Canada, a new proprietary seamless steel grade — TN 80EY — that is ideal for Montney conditions, says a company representative.
“We have been working on this for the past couple of years, seeing a need as you see more development in those shale areas,” Shellie Clark, commercial vice-president at Tenaris, told the Bulletin. “There’s opportunity elsewhere in the world, but we’ve consolidated a lot of efforts from groups around the world to build this for Canada.”
According to the company, its new steel grade, built at the Sault Ste. Marie facility, is applicable in severe sour conditions often associated with unconventional shale environments, and is adaptable to high contents of hydrogen sulphide, which is relevant for many Canadian pipeline customers. The new steel grade provides an improved burst compared to the L80-ICY steel grade, and it is a cost-competitive alternative to API T95.
“To date, there have only been two options available for sour areas — areas such as the Montney shale gas and unconventional areas in Canada,” Clark said, highlighting that one current option is below requirements, while the other is too high-spec. “This [new] product is now providing an option for those operators. It’s basically more custom made.”
She added: “It’s purpose-built for these mid-range-type parts of the reservoir, where in the end it’s a more cost-effective solution for the customer.”
When developing TN 80EY, Tenaris considered unique National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Region 3 challenges, such as physical phenomenon associated with sour service environments known as sulfide stress cracking or H2S embrittlement.
The product is not a pipeline grade, noted Clark, but is a grade of steel specifically used in well construction. “And so, you install casing in the hole, and you produce through that.”
The competition
Although there is probably a similar product available in the market to the TN 80EY steel grade, noted Clark, that would be an imported product, and one that is not manufactured in a controlled process, but rather identified as having the desired characteristics from sorting stacks of pipe, and then set aside. “They can’t verify and control the reliability and mechanical specs, essentially, through the product.”
By comparison, she told the DOB, Tenaris’s newly-developed steel grade is a mechanically-engineered, controlled product, which is better and safer for sour applications. “We worked directly with our customers, and this is a benefit to them of being able to work with the mill. That’s a distinct difference to competitive products currently out there.”
She added: “The other thing too is that we’re manufacturing this in Canada for our Canadian customers. And so, it’s unique that way. Because of that, we’re able to respond much more quickly to their lead times, which is also an attractive alternative.”
New investments
Late last year, Tenaris announced plans to transform its industrial operations to preserve long-term sustainability and growth in Canada, thanks in part to a $9 million Ontario government investment in Tenaris Algoma Tubes that leverages more than $117 million in private sector investments, creating 153 high-paying local jobs. Tenaris Algoma Tubes manufactures seamless oil country tubular goods (OCTG) and line-pipe products for the oil and gas sector.
Development of the TN 80EY product is in addition to the recent investment, noted Clark, although she said that investment probably aligns with why the company is making this new product for its customers. “We’re increasing our product portfolio, and ensuring that we can produce more in Canada for Canada. By the end of that investment, we will be able to produce about 90 per cent of what we sell.”
Product timeline
Tenaris has developed its new steel grade through the time-tested process of working closely with the operators as production requirements evolve, identifying solution gaps and utilizing the steel manufacturer’s robust engineering and technical resources and personnel to fill those gaps, said Clark.
“From those gaps, we propose and work with the R&D groups in other countries — our metallurgy department, our engineering and the technical sales — to see if there’s something we can do to adapt something we currently have, or to re-engineer something completely.
“If there is something and we see demand for it, which in this case is the growing area of the Montney, then that’s where we invest more time in developing and testing the product. It’s an iterative process. This is one of nine products we built specifically for Canada, and one of two that we’re releasing this year.”
So far, the TN 80EY product is qualified and tested, meeting all regulatory requirements, and the next step is to run the steel grade with a customer, she added.
“We’re manufacturing it at the beginning of 2022. We have customers who are very much looking forward to this, because it will impact their well costs considerably, and they achieve a better product than their options are today. We haven’t run it yet, but we expect to in Q1 2022.”

"Asia LNG Price Soars On China Power Crunch, European Demand | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — Asia LNG prices soared this week, as the world's top buyer China faced an ongoing power crunch and low inventory in Europe drove up competition for the super-chilled fuel.
The average LNG price for November delivery into Northeast Asia was estimated at about $37/mmBtu, up nearly 16 per cent from the previous week, industry sources said.
December delivery prices were estimated to be about $38/mmBtu, they added.
Price agency S&P Global Platts's Japan-Korea-Marker (JKM), which is widely used as a benchmark in the spot market, had surged to a record high of $56.326/mmBtu on Wednesday, before easing later in the week.
""The market is still very bullish for winter and any piece of headline is driving up sentiment,"" a Singapore-based trader said.
Gazprom's China-focused Amur gas processing plant in Russia's Far East has halted operations after a fire early on Friday, a spokesman for the plant told Reuters.
The broader implications were not immediately clear, but the plant plays an important part in Russian gas exports to China, which has been hit by electricity shortages that have led to power rationing across the country.
Bangladesh bought on LNG cargo from Vitol for delivery in mid-October at $35.89/mmBtu and another from Gunvor for late October delivery at $36.95/mmBtu, which are the highest prices paid by the country for spot cargoes, an official of state-run Petrobangla said.
Freight rates to ship LNG rose this week and are at multi-month highs as the increase in LNG demand has driven up the need for vessels to move supplies, sources said.
Production issues at Sakhalin and Indonesia are also supporting prices, a Singapore-based source said.
Pakistan may consider only relying on term supplies should current spot prices remain elevated, an industry source said.

"China Digs In On Coal, Oil Gains As Energy Crisis Deepens | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — China ordered miners in Inner Mongolia to ramp up coal production and oil prices jumped on Friday.
The rebound in economic activity from coronavirus restrictions has exposed alarmingly low supplies of natural gas leaving traders, industry executives and governments scrambling as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.
The energy crisis, which has led to fuel shortages and blackouts in some countries, has highlighted the difficulty in cutting the global economy's dependency on fossil fuels as world leaders seek to revive efforts to tackle climate change at talks next month in Glasgow.
In China, where coal production had been curtailed to meet climate goals, officials have ordered more than 70 coal mines in Inner Mongolia to ramp up production by nearly 100 million tonnes or 10 per cent, as the world's largest exporter battles its worst power shortages in years.
Russia's Gazprom, a key supplier of gas to China, calmed fears that a fire at a major gas processing plant could worsen the situation, saying it was able to continue exporting gas to China as normal.
India, the second largest coal consumer after China, is also suffering electricity outages because of a lack of coal with over half of its coal-fired power plants having less than three days’ worth of fuel stocks, data from the federal grid operator showed.
Oil prices rose on Friday, on track for gains of nearly five per cent this week, as industries switch fuel. ""A lot of catalysts are out there to keep the oil market tight,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.
Reflecting the gravity of the situation, the United States has not ruled out tapping into its strategic petroleum reserves, which it typically only does after major supply disruptions such as hurricanes, or pursuing a ban on oil exports to bring down the cost of crude oil, though there are doubts it is ready to take such action yet.
""DOE is actively monitoring global energy market supply and will work with our agency partners to determine if and when actions are needed,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Energy said.
Stoking tensions
Global fuel shortages are another blow to a world economy just getting back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic and threaten an expensive winter for consumers.
China is going to allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20 per cent from base levels, instead of 10-15 per cent previously, in order to prevent high energy consumption, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday, citing a meeting of the State Council, or cabinet.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, bought two cargoes of LNG for delivery in October at record prices, two industry sources said on Friday, as low stocks in Europe boosts competition with Asia for supplies.
""It is really tough to cope with such abnormal prices. At the moment, we have no other option but to buy to keep economic activities going,"" an official of state-run Petrobangla, which oversees LNG supplies, said.  
Bangladesh is reviewing leases of five oil-fired power plants which are nearing expiry, despite its plan to move from oil towards natural gas for power generation.
Even before the current energy crisis erupted, the world was far behind on efforts to avert catastrophic climate change with a United Nations analysis estimating that global emissions would be 16 per cent higher in 2030 than they were in 2010 based on countries' current pledges.
Surging energy prices are stoking tensions in Europe over the green transition. Wealthier nations want to keep up the pressure to quit fossil fuels while poorer ones, worried about the cost to the consumer, are wary.
Britain's energy regulator warned that energy bills, which have just been hiked, are likely to rise significantly in April due to high wholesale costs which have forced some suppliers out of business.
Divisions within the European Union have deepened, with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban blaming European Union action to combat climate change for the current crisis and saying Poland and Hungary would present a united front at the next EU summit.
Analysts have said rising gas prices are the main driver of European electricity costs, while the soaring cost of permits on the EU carbon market has contributed around a fifth of the power price increase.

"Initial Agreement Between B.C., Blueberry River First Nations Is ‘Clearly Good News,’ Says EPAC President | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) says yesterday’s announcement that Blueberry River First Nations and the B.C. government have reached an initial agreement is a positive step forward for all involved.
“This is clearly good news for B.C. natural gas development, B.C. Indigenous nations and all B.C. workers,” Tristan Goodman said in a statement.
“I have confidence that building on this positive momentum we will reach a new place for everyone involved that can obtain better results on cumulative impacts, protect Indigenous rights and allow our industry to develop B.C.’s clean natural gas resources that the world so desperately needs. It’s a good day.”
As part of the agreement, 195 forestry and oil and gas projects, which were permitted or authorized prior to the court decision and where activities have not yet started, will proceed. Twenty currently approved authorizations, which relate to development activities in areas of high cultural importance, will not proceed without further negotiation and agreement from Blueberry. The province has provided notification to the respective permit holders.
A spokesperson for the B.C. Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation said that of the 20 affected authorizations/permits that were previously approved but not part of this agreement, 12 were oil and gas-related permits while the other eight were forestry.
“All affected permit holders have been notified,” the spokesperson said.
Brad Herald, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers’ vice-president of Western Canada operations, said the oil and gas industry “welcomes the clarity” provided on existing approved authorizations outlined in the agreement between Blueberry River First Nations and the Province of British Columbia.
“This is an important initial step for the work to come with the engagement process and development of interim and long-term approaches for reviewing authorizations of new natural resource activities,” he said.
“We believe our partnerships with Indigenous communities and businesses support economic reconciliation; a key part of Canada’s overall approach to reconciliation.”
As reported in the DOB, no new wells were approved in B.C. in August, as the province continues to work with the BRFN on a way to improve and modernize provincial processes that recognize and respect their treaty rights.
Earlier this summer, the B.C. Supreme Court found the provincial government breached the Treaty 8 agreement signed with the BRFN because it allowed development such as forestry and natural gas extraction without the community’s approval.
Agreement detail
Blueberry River First Nations and the B.C. government reached an initial agreement, announced Thursday afternoon, “that begins to support healing the land, and helps provide stability and certainty for forestry and oil and gas permit holders in Blueberry’s traditional territory in the immediate term,” the province announced today.
The agreement follows the historic June 29, 2021, B.C. Supreme Court ruling in Blueberry River First Nations (Yahey) v. Province of British Columbia, which determined the Treaty 8 rights of the Blueberry River First Nations have been breached by development authorized by the provincial government over many years.
The initial agreement is a first step in responding to the B.C. Supreme Court’s decision, which requires the province and Blueberry to work together to develop land management processes in Blueberry territory that restore and protect the ability of the land to support Indigenous ways of life, and ensure future development authorizations manage cumulative effects on land and wildlife and their impact on the Nation’s treaty rights.
Under the agreement, the province will establish a $35-million fund for Blueberry to undertake activities to heal the land, creating jobs for Nation members and business for service providers in the northeast region. Activities will include:

land, road and seismic restoration;
river, stream and wetland restoration;
habitat connectivity;
native seed and nursery projects; and,
training for restoration activities.

In addition, $30 million will be allocated to support the Blueberry River First Nations in protecting their Indigenous way of life. Activities will include:

work on cultural areas, traplines, cabins and trails;
educational activities and materials, including teaching traditional skills and language;
expanding Blueberry River resources and capacity for land management; and,
restoring the health of wildlife through wildlife management, habitat enhancement including prescribed burning, and research.

The province and Blueberry are now working to finalize an interim approach for reviewing new natural resource activities that balance Treaty 8 rights, the economy and the environment.
Once an interim approach is in place, the negotiation teams will work to reach long-term solutions that protect Treaty 8 rights and an Indigenous way of life. They will explore establishing areas for protection and developing ecosystem-based management systems to incorporate cumulative impacts into decision-making.
The solutions will work to reset the balance promised in Treaty 8, ensuring environmental sustainability, protection of Treaty 8 rights and Indigenous culture, and stable economic activity and employment.
The province is starting dialogue with the other Treaty 8 Nations on matters of treaty rights, including advancing new environmental restoration work across Treaty 8 territory and ensuring all Treaty 8 Nations are part of the development of a new approach to how natural resource activity is planned and authorized in the territory.
The province and Blueberry will provide regular updates to, and seek input from, Blueberry members, industry, local governments and residents of the northeast as negotiations proceed.

Record Gas Prices Slow LNG Investment In Asia; N. America Scrambles On Exports | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Some of the world's biggest importers of LNG are reducing orders in the face of a 500 per cent price surge within a year, raising concerns among major producers about potential long-term destruction of demand.
LNG buyers, including numerous emerging economies in Asia, are balking at prices that have doubled just within the past month, while a growing number of exporters in North America are straining to boost export capacity that will still take years to come online.
Natural gas is viewed as a more acceptable fossil fuel as growing economies like India, China and Pakistan try to reduce carbon emissions, because it burns more cleanly than oil and coal. But the surge in natural gas prices is prompting power providers to revert to coal and fuel oil and causing a rethink on new LNG investments in Southeast Asia, which was expected to be the heart of LNG demand growth.
Within Asia, which accounts for 70 per cent of global LNG imports, a majority of long-term contracts are oil-linked. But South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh — which together account for 20 per cent of Asia's imports — have a much higher exposure to spot LNG prices, which are currently at a record high of over $50/mmBtu.
That's raised alarm among developers in Southeast Asia, as analysts say plans for new LNG regasification terminals may now be delayed given the high LNG prices and after government budgets were stretched by costly COVID-19 outbreaks, a source familiar with contract negotiations said.
""New buyers are under a lot of pressure to justify signing contracts at these prices, so they have been slow to progress discussions,"" said the source, who has noted a sharp fall in enthusiasm among potential buyers to even discuss LNG projects compared to a year ago. He declined to provide more details or be named due to the sensitive nature of the deals.
For big U.S. export terminal operators, rising prices were initially welcome. However, the volatility in costs makes it harder to sign additional long-term contracts and is a source of frustration, as they know that they will only be able to add incremental export capacity in the next year.
""We didn't like the low and flat prices everywhere in the world of around $2 per mmBtu from a year ago, and I'm not sure what I dislike more with the very elevated prices we find ourselves in now,"" said Anatol Feygin, chief commercial officer at Cheniere Energy Inc., the largest LNG exporter in the United States. ""It is a manifestation of the markets not being very good at investing through the cycle.""
Feygin however said Cheniere would soon decide on an additional expansion at its Corpus Christi LNG export plant in Texas, noting that global prices, when compared with lower U.S. prices, are a tailwind for the company.
U.S. benchmark gas prices are currently at seven-year highs, but at $6/mmBtu, are far from Asian and European levels. The United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcf/d of gas into LNG.
Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States, when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.
After that, the world may have to wait even longer for additional U.S. or Canadian projects. Houston-based Tellurian Inc.,which announced three long-term deals over the summer to sell LNG to units of Royal Dutch Shell plc, Vitol SA and Gunvor Group, is expected to start producing LNG in late 2025 at the earliest, said Charif Souki, executive chairman.
In British Columbia, LNG Canada is not expected to go into service until around 2025. In addition, numerous proposed projects were scuttled between 2019 and 2020 due to persistently low prices.
Lack of investment
Asia's newer buyers of LNG are more affected by price volatility than established importers, who are able to blunt the impact of higher spot prices by pooling those purchases with existing lower cost oil-linked deliveries, said Wood Mackenzie Ltd. vice-president Valery Chow.
""Rising LNG import bills are putting a severe strain on national budgets and [Bangladesh and Pakistan] are actively looking to switch away from gas in favour of lower cost alternatives, like fuel oil, for power generation,"" Chow said.
Bangladesh has cut back on LNG imports, with September's total dropping by 33 per cent from the month before, Refinitiv Eikon shiptracking data showed. The country is also considering extending the leases of five oil-fired power plants and potentially increasing fuel oil imports.
Pakistan has been cancelling and re-issuing LNG tenders the past two months, and may consider relying on just term imports going forward, an industry source said.
There are signs of demand erosion in established buyers India and China. LNG imports into India are down 4.2 per cent through September compared to the same period in 2020. In China, second-tier gas importers — mostly city-gas firms —are scaling back spot purchases.
In South Korea, Asia's third largest importer, one buyer described the situation as ""chaos.”
""The current market situation is not healthy to be in,"" said Qatar's Energy Minister Saad al-Kaabi on the sidelines of a virtual LNG conference in Japan. The country is the world's largest LNG supplier, and has said it will boost output by about 40 per cent to 110 million tonnes per annum by 2026.
If LNG prices extend their recent run up, cost-conscious buyers may have no choice but to pare back demand.
""With winter... and no sign of any softening in LNG prices, demand side management and ultimately power rationing may be a last resort,"" said Chow at Wood Mackenzie.

Russia Says Nord Stream 2 Clearance May Cool Gas Prices In Europe | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that certification of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline, which expects clearance from a Germany's regulator, could cool soaring European gas prices.
Prices have spiked in response to a recovery in demand, particularly from Asia, when storage levels are low.
""I think there are two factors, which could somewhat cool off the current situation. First of all, of course, this is, definitely, completion of certification and the fastest clearance for gas supplies via the completed Nord Stream 2,"" Novak told a meeting of government officials and heads of energy companies.
Nord Stream 2, which runs on the bed of the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, is expecting certification from Germany, which could take a few months. The pipeline has faced resistance from the United States, which says the project will increase Europe's reliance on Russian energy.
Novak said an increase in gas sales on Gazprom's Electronic Sales Platform could also calm prices. Gazprom set up the ESP in 2018 for gas sales to Europe to supplement the existing long and mid-term contracts. It has suspended gas sales for delivery in 2022 since late August.
President Vladimir Putin, who chaired the meeting, has agreed with the proposed increase, adding that Russia should meet its domestic gas needs first.
Novak said some speculative trade could also be behind the soaring gas prices, which he said did not reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand.
Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, at the meeting asked Putin for the right to export natural gas from Russia. State television did not air Putin's reaction to the request.
Long-term deals
Putin told the meeting that Europe was wrong to reduce the share of long-term deals in natural gas trade in favour of the spot market instead, where prices have surged.
""We talked to the European Commission's previous lineup, and all its activity was aimed at phasing out of so-called long-term contracts,"" he said.
""It was aimed at transition to spot gas trade. And as it turned out, it has become obvious today, that this practice is a mistake.""
Gazprom has resisted moving to spot trade in Europe, preferring long-term deals, which sometimes last around 25 years.
Putin also reiterated that Russia has been a reliable energy supplier to Europe, which may see record-high Russian gas exports this year as Moscow is increasing gas supplies, including via Ukraine, in response to the energy crunch and stands ready to stabilize the market.
He said that Russian gas transit via Ukraine is set to exceed volumes agreed under Gazprom's contract with Kyiv.
Kremlin denial
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia had absolutely no role in causing Europe's surging gas prices, following accusations from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some in the European Parliament that Russia had not done enough to increase supplies to Europe.
""There are a couple of reasons [behind the gas crisis] — the way the economy is recovering, how demand for the energy resources is growing, as well gas storages are not filled in,"" Peskov told reporters on a daily conference call.
Putin also cited economic recovery and cold weather in Europe, which led to a reduction in gas storage as another reason behind the gas prices surge.
Peskov said Moscow was ready to discuss new long-term contracts for gas sales to European consumers and that Gazprom was meeting all its obligations.

Chief Oil & Gas Explores Sale For More Than $3B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Chief Oil & Gas LLC, the Appalachian exploration and production company founded and controlled by Texas wildcatter Trevor Rees-Jones, is exploring a sale that could value it at more than $3 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said.
Rees-Jones launched Chief Oil & Gas in 1994, and it is now one of the largest privately-owned natural gas producers in the United States. His decision to attempt a sale now comes as energy prices have surged to multi-year highs, boosting corporate valuations in the industry.
Chief Oil & Gas has hired an investment bank to begin a sale process for the company, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
A Chief Oil & Gas spokesperson declined to comment.
Chief Oil & Gas operates in the Marcellus shale in northeastern Pennsylvania and has around 600,000 net acres, producing more than one bcf/d of natural gas.
The company started out in the Barnett shale formation in Texas but sold its position there in two chunks, the first going to Devon Energy Corporation in 2006 and the second to Quicksilver Resources in 2008, according to its website.
Another privately held Marcellus natural gas producer, Alta Resources, was sold in July to EQT Corp. for $2.9 billion. Alta had around 300,000 net acres and produced one bcf/d of gas.

"Shell Flags $400 Million Hurricane Hit, But Boost From Soaring Prices | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
 (Reuters) — Royal Dutch Shell plc warned on Thursday of a $400 million hit to third-quarter earnings from the damage caused by August's Hurricane Ida.
However, in an update ahead of quarterly results this month, the oil major also flagged a boost to cash flows from soaring natural gas and electricity prices.
Gas and power prices have been surging as tight gas supplies have collided with strong demand in economies recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shell is the world's top seller of LNG accounting for about 20 per cent of global demand, though its sales have declined in recent months because of production problems.
The company said third-quarter cash flow at its LNG division ""is expected to be significantly impacted by large variation margin inflows on the back of the prevailing gas and electricity price environment"".
Shell will be holding more cash from buyers as deposits in the face of the large fluctuations in gas prices. The cash will eventually flow back out as prices cool.
Liquefaction in the quarter is expected to be between 7 and 7.5 million tonnes, the lowest since 2016, ""reflecting feedgas constraints and additional maintenance"", Shell said.
LNG earnings will, however, receive a boost from stronger trading results, it added.
Shell's upstream oil and gas production fell in the quarter to between 2.025 and 2.1 million boe/d owing to a prolonged outage of about 90,000 boe/d at some of its offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida.
Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, said sales volumes were expected to be between 4.3 and 5.3 million bbls/d, the highest since the first quarter of 2020 but still well below pre-pandemic levels.
Refinery utilization rates will be impacted by outages due to Hurricane Ida.
In the second quarter, Shell boosted its dividend by 38 per cent for a second consecutive quarter and launched a $2 billion share buyback program following the sharp rise in oil and gas prices.

Pennsylvania Charges Energy Transfer With Environmental Crimes | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro charged Energy Transfer LP with 48 counts of environmental crimes for its conduct during construction of the long-delayed Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline.
""There is a duty to protect our air and water, and when companies harm these vital resources through negligence — it is a crime,” Shapiro said in a statement.
Mariner East has been slowed by numerous work stoppages by state and local officials mostly related to sinkholes that developed near the pipeline or spills of drilling fluids used to bore under waterways.
Energy Transfer, which was not immediately available for comment, said recently it planned to complete all phases of the pipeline expansion by the end of 2021.
Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus/Utica shale in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer's Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia.
The Attorney General's office said that in addition to repeatedly spilling thousands of gallons of drilling fluid, Energy Transfer on several occasions failed to report the spills to state environmental regulators in spite of the legal requirement to do so.
In addition, the Attorney General's office said the drilling fluid contained unapproved additives at multiple locations that affected drinking water in wells.
“If convicted, this company will be sentenced to fines and restitution. There is no jail time for these environmental crimes, and fines are not enough,"" Shapiro said, noting his office was ""calling for stronger laws to hold these companies accountable.""
Energy Transfer started work on the $2.5 billion Mariner East expansion in February 2017 and originally planned to finish the 563-kilometre pipeline in the third quarter of 2017.
Since May 2017, Pennsylvania has issued about 125 notices of violation to Mariner East, mostly for drilling fluid spills, including two in September.

Southwest Gas To Buy Questar For $2B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Southwest Gas Holdings Inc. said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Questar Pipelines from Dominion Energy for $1.975 billion, hours after activist investor Carl Icahn made public his objections to it.
For Southwest Gas, paying $1.545 billion in cash and assuming $430 million of debt, the acquisition marks a northward expansion of its operations and boosts its regulated business.
""The acquisition ... will provide significant financial and strategic benefits to our company, shareholders, employees and partners,"" said Southwest Gas chief executive John Hester, adding the deal would be accretive to earnings per share in 2022.
The announcement confirmed a Reuters report from Sunday, saying Southwest Gas was in advanced talks to acquire Questar, citing people familiar with the matter.
Referencing the article in a letter to Southwest Gas's board, released earlier on Tuesday and detailing he holds a large stake in the company, Icahn said the acquisition would seriously diminish shareholder value and urged its abandonment.
Southwest Gas should instead focus on improving share price performance, which lagged peers, said the investor who has a history of agitating against U.S. utilities.  
Given Southwest Gas is paying cash, its shareholders will not vote on approving the acquisition, as they would if the company was issuing a large amount of stock to finance it.
For Dominion, the divestment comes after a previous attempt to sell Questar to the energy arm of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was called off in July over uncertainty whether antitrust regulators would approve it.  
In its own statement, Dominion said proceeds would pay down debt and support spending plans. The deal will close before year-end, subject to regulatory approval.
Questar Pipelines provides interstate natural gas transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.  
Southwest Gas serves more than two million customers in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Investment bank Lazard and law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP worked on the deal for Southwest Gas. Dominion received financial and legal advice from, respectively, Barclays and McGuireWoods LLP.

PETRONAS Plans To Scale Up CCS At Kasawari Gas Field | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — PETRONAS plans to scale up a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project as part of the second phase of development at the Kasawari gas field off Sarawak, its CEO said.
The CCS project at the field, which is estimated to hold three tcf of gas reserves, is key to the state energy firm's plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
""This will potentially be one of the world's largest CCS projects,"" CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Aziz said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday at the Reuters Impact conference.
It will be able to capture more than 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, he said.
""It's a tricky project because it needs to deal with our own system requirements,"" he said.
""It is something that we think can be scaled up in phase two,"" he said, but declined to elaborate on the potential cost involved as the project will have to be tendered out.
While profitable and scalable CCS projects remain scarce, Taufik said he was confident that the planned stream of global investments in CCS will make it a viable means for energy firms to curb emissions.
""There are many, many projects in place in Scandinavia, our counterparts in Norway, and we've also got a template out in Australia where CCS has been deployed,"" he said.
""The question is whether the scale is large enough to make it economic.""
The Kasawari project will also ensure that PETRONAS remains one of the world's top five exporters of LNG, Taufik said.
Global gas demand accelerated this year with Asia spot prices LNG-AS hitting all-time highs as economies recover from the pandemic.
""The reality is, in any projections, even IEA's most aggressive projections of renewables displacement, we will still need hydrocarbons to be part of the energy mix,"" Taufik said, adding that natural gas will account for about a quarter of the world's energy demand.
""Many of us, my counterparts and I, believe that CCS will be part of the solution to decarbonize the extraction of hydrocarbons,"" he said.
PETRONAS is also looking at offering CCS as a solution for power and the cement, steel and chemicals sectors which are facing challenges in reducing billions of tonnes of emissions, Taufik said, adding that carbon taxes and carbon pricing will be key in making these projects economical.
He declined to comment on the carbon price that PETRONAS applies to its projects.

U.S. Natgas Futures On Track For 7-Year High As Global Prices Soar | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — U.S. natural gas futures jumped four per cent and were on track to reach a fresh seven-year high on Tuesday as soaring global prices kept demand for U.S. LNG exports strong.
Futures prices in Europe soared over 17 per cent for November and 18 per cent for December to fresh record highs on worries several European countries do not have enough gas stored for the coming winter heating season. Prices in Asia also traded near record levels as China and other major LNG buyers compete for available cargoes to meet their insatiable demand for the super-cooled fuel.
In the United States, traders noted that prices were rising despite forecasts for U.S. weather to remain milder than normal through late October, which should keep overall heating and cooling demand lower than usual. Of course, some regions will see lingering air conditioning use, while others will crank up their heaters.
Front-month gas futures rose 22.9 cents, or four per cent to $5.995/mmBtu at 8:11 a.m. EDT (1211 GMT), putting the contract on track for its highest close since February 2014.
Analysts have said that stockpiles in some European countries were over 20 per cent below normal for this time of year. In the United States, meanwhile, inventories were expected to reach about 3.5 tcf by the end of October. Analysts said that should be enough for the U.S. winter heating season even though that amount would fall short of the 3.7 tcf five-year (2016-2020) average for that time of year.
Belief that the United States will have enough gas in storage for this winter and a lack of capacity to export more LNG has kept U.S. prices from rocketing to the record levels seen in Europe and Asia, but pipeline constraints and competition for expensive LNG exports were expected to boost prices to multi-year highs in California and New England this winter.
Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to an average of 91.7 bcf/d so far in October from 91.1 bcf/d in September. That compares with a monthly record of 95.4 bcf/d in November 2019.
U.S. gas demand, including exports, would slide from an average of 85.0 bcf/d this week to 83.6 bcf/d next week as the weather turns milder. That was the same as Refinitiv's forecast on Monday.
With gas prices at or near record highs of $38/mmBtu in Europe and $32 in Asia, versus just $6 in the United States, traders said buyers around the world would keep purchasing all the LNG the United States could produce.
With Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland expected to remain shut for another week of planned maintenance, Refinitiv said the amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants slipped to an average of 10.2 bcf/d so far in October from 10.4 bcf/d in September.
But no matter how high global prices rise, the United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcf/d of gas into LNG. Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.

The investment firm will pay $17 per common unit of U.S.-listed Teekay, both companies said Monday in a statement.  
LNG spot prices in Asia hit a record last week as competition with European buyers heats up ahead of peak demand during the winter season, with storage levels already at multi-year lows.
Teekay has interests in 47 LNG carriers and 21 mid-size LPG carriers, plus seven multi-gas carriers, according to the statement.
LNG tankers hauling gas to Asia are commanding about $70,500 dollars a day while ships heading for Europe are fetching $64,000, according to Spark Commodities, which takes assessments from shipbrokers.
Including debt, the deal is valued at about $6.2 billion.

Natgas Price Surge Looms For United States This Winter | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Regional natural gas markets in the United States are seeing prices for this winter surge along with global record highs — suggesting that the energy bills causing headaches in Europe and Asia will hit the country before long.
Gas prices in Europe and Asia have more than tripled this year, causing manufacturers to curtail activity from Spain to Britain and sparking power crises in China.
The United States has been shielded from that global crunch because it has plenty of gas supply, most of which stays in the country since U.S. export capacity is still relatively small.
The benchmark U.S. natural gas contract has been rallying, lately hitting seven-year highs, but its $5.62/mmBtu price is a far cry from the $30-plus being paid in Europe and Asia.
However, the U.S. market is worried about the coming cold, particularly in New England and California — where prices for gas to be delivered this winter are far above the nationwide benchmark. In New England, buyers are expecting gas to cost more than $20/mmBtu.
High winter prices are nothing new for New England and California, where the limited number of pipelines into both regions regularly become constrained on the coldest days. But this winter could be worse.
Both regions have spent years aggressively moving away from fossil fuels through regulations, power plant retirements and carbon pricing that makes power from fossil-fired generation, particularly coal, more expensive.
U.S. gas currently being delivered to the Henry Hub terminal in Louisiana, the nation's benchmark, recently surpassed $6 for the first time since 2014. For January that price is in the same range, suggesting buyers think the country as a whole will have ample pipeline and storage access to keep fuel flowing this winter.
""Henry Hub prices continue to climb for the winter months, but we should see even bigger increases on the East and West Coasts for New England and California,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at commodity analytics firm Kpler.
In New England, gas for January delivery is soaring, trading this week at more than $22 at the region's Algonquin hub, which would be the highest price paid in a month since January and February of 2014.
That reflects the region, which turns to LNG when its pipelines become congested, will have to compete with buyers in Europe and Asia already paying a lot more for the super-cooled fuel.
Gas-fired power plants are expected to produce about 49 per cent of the electricity generated in New England. That is in line with the last five years, but overall demand is rising as the economy has recovered.
""What is driving gas prices for us is expected increased demand for pipeline gas as the economy recovers, and supply is catching up after pandemic low demand,"" said Caroline Pretyman, a spokesperson at Eversource Energy, New England's biggest energy provider.
California dreamin' on a winter's day
Prices at the Southern California Citygate for January 2022 were trading over $13 this week, which would be a record outside of February 2021, when the Texas freeze pushed gas prices to record levels in many parts of the country.
Prices are up in California because the state has been suffering through a long drought that has restricted its ability to generate electricity through hydropower. Solar has also been constrained by smoke cover from wildfires, analysts said.
As a result, the state has relied more on gas-fired plants, which are expected to account for about 45 per cent of electricity generated this winter, above the five-year average of 41 per cent as the drought limits hydropower supplies, according to federal projections.
Just four per cent of the electricity produced in California will come from hydro facilities this year, according to federal projections, down from an average of 14 per cent over the past five years.
Unlike New England, California has access to gas supplies from more regions including the Permian in Texas and New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and Canada.
New England imports roughly 16 bcf of LNG during the winter, equivalent to about five per cent of its winter gas consumption. However, competition from Europe and Asia means those shipments will come at a dear cost.
Some power generators have another option — switching to burning oil. Right now, fuel oil costs about three times as much as natural gas, so that kind of switch will only happen as gas prices rise. Oil also emits about 30 per cent more carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
Analysts expect New England to start burning oil sooner than usual this year. Notably, during an extreme cold event starting in late December 2017, oil spiked to 27 per cent of overall power generation, compared with less than one per cent earlier that month, according to ISO New England, the region's grid operator.

Fossil Fuel Demand Shakes Off Pandemic | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Demand for coal and natural gas has exceeded pre-COVID-19 highs with oil not far behind.
Global natural gas shortages, record gas and coal prices, a power crunch in China and a three-year high on oil prices all tell one story — demand for energy has roared back and the world still needs fossil fuels to meet most of those energy needs.
""The demand fall during the pandemic was entirely linked to governments' decision to restrict movements and had nothing to do with the energy transition,"" Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand analysis at FGE told Reuters.
""The energy transition and decarbonization are decade-long strategies and do not happen overnight.""
Over three-quarters of global energy demand is still met by fossil fuels with less than a fifth by non-nuclear renewables, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Energy transition policies have come under fire for the run up in energy prices. In some places, they are having an impact, such as in Europe where high carbon prices aimed at reducing emissions have made utilities reluctant to switch on coal-fired plants to alleviate the shortage.
In China, policies to reduce emissions have contributed to the government's decision to ration energy to heavy industry.
But much of the rise in energy prices is simply because producers took enormous amounts of capacity offline last year when the pandemic led to an unprecedented fall in demand.
Producers of gas, coal, and to a lesser extent oil have been caught flat-footed by the economic recovery, much of it sparked by government stimulus spending in energy-intensive industries.
National policies have also played a role in the power supply problems. In China, state mandated power prices mean utilities simply cannot afford to burn coal and sell the power, because the cost of coal is too high to make a profit.
Chinese utilities are producing below capacity to avoid losing money, not because they cannot produce more.
Meanwhile, most gas projects take several years to design and build, so the shortage now reflects investment decisions taken pre-pandemic — and before the energy transition gathered political momentum.
The chief of the Paris-based IEA said energy transition policies were not to blame for the crisis.
""Well-managed clean energy transitions are a solution to the issues that we are seeing in gas and electricity markets today — not the cause of them,"" Fatih Birol said in a statement.
2020 losses erased
Still, the IEA's data show global demand for coal, the single largest source of CO2 emissions, surpassed pre-pandemic levels late last year.
Global coal supplies are tight because China, responsible for around half of global output, has tightened safety regulations at mines after a spate of accidents, sapping supply.
That has left China importing more coal from Indonesia, in turn leaving less for other importers such as India.
Global coal demand is set for with a 4.5 per cent increase this year, pushing beyond 2019 levels.
Global natural gas demand fell 1.9 per cent last year, a smaller drop than other energy sources as utilities cranked up power production to meet heating needs during winter.
But the IEA projects gas demand will rise 3.2 per cent in 2021 to over four trillion cubic metres, erasing 2020 losses, and pushing demand above 2019 levels.
Cold weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy said, ""caused a rise in demand for coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG), electricity and even a bit of oil [that] is here to stay.""
LNG accounts for just over 10 per cent of the global supply but is more readily traded globally so can be deployed more easily to cover short-term supply crunches.
""Eye-popping price spikes and their spread between summer and winter will widen, especially for gas, both natural and liquefied,"" Rystad added, as prices are higher amid cold winter weather than in summer.
Supply gaps, short-term rallies
Last to catch up, oil demand is set to rebound toward pre-pandemic levels above 100 million bbls/d sometime next year, according to four of the major tracking groups.
High prices on oil markets are because OPEC and allied producers still have millions of bbls per day of oil production offline after they made record cuts to supply during the pandemic to match plummeting demand for transport fuel.
OPEC offers the most robust prediction for a demand rebound, putting the recovery date at the second quarter of 2022.
In the more distant future, with most forecasters predicting a peak in fossil fuel demand within the next two decades and the IEA recommending against new projects to ensure net zero emissions, broader supply gaps could fuel more price shocks.
""Prices for fossil fuels will remain volatile"", said Nikos Tsafos, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
""The risk of a supply-demand imbalance is greater in a market that is shrinking where the case for further investment is weak, which could produce short-term rallies.""

Higher Natural Gas Prices To Drive Exxon Q3 Earnings | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Exxon Mobil Corporation signalled on Thursday that higher oil and gas prices would boost third-quarter earnings by as much as $1.5 billion over the second quarter.
Natural gas prices in the United States have more than doubled this year and oil prices are up 52 per cent as energy demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exxon also has been cutting costs and laying off personnel following a historic loss in 2020. Lower costs coupled with the recent rebound in oil and gas have driven profit sharply higher.
Natural gas prices should give the U.S. oil producer the largest increase in operating profit in the quarter, the company signalled in a corporate filing. Profit from natural could rise US$500–$900 million this quarter over last, it said.
U.S. natural gas prices were trading at almost $6/mmBtu on Thursday.
Healthier refining margins could add from $500 million to $700 million in operating profits this quarter. Exxon quarter results will be posted on Oct. 29.
Chemical margins, on the other hand, could cut operating profit by between $200 million and $400 million in the quarter, the company said in the filing.
It also said unsettled derivatives could reduce operating profit from oil and gas production by $100–$500 million in the period.
Last year, the company suffered a $680 million loss in the third quarter on lower oil prices and production volumes.

Indigenous Participation In Latest Canadian LNG Proposals Breaking New Ground | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Cedar LNG and Ksi Lisims LNG projects are breaking new ground in allowing Indigenous people to participate in developments that could have a huge impact on their communities, while also serving as a counterpoint to LNG developments in the U.S., says a doctoral student at the University of Calgary.
“Liquefied natural gas export is a really exciting opportunity for Canada to demonstrate its leadership in climate change mitigation, as well as fostering economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Particularly when we stack ourselves up to our neighbours south of the 49th parallel,” Kienan Marion, at the UofC’s department of geoscience, said in a presentation at the recent GeoConvention 2021 event.
Marion presented the results of the paper “Comparison of GHG Emissions from LNG Canada to American Alternatives: The Canadian Advantage,” which was co-written by Deborah Esquivias and Travis Brookson (each at the UofC’s School of Public Policy) Pengfei Zhao (University of Toronto, department of civil and mineral engineering) and Jose Rogelio Hernandez Borbon (UofC, department of civil engineering).
During 2021, two Indigenous-led projects have reached important milestones, Marion said. (Note: A DOB special report published at the beginning of last year outlined Indigenous participation in previously announced Canadian LNG projects.)
First, the Nisga’a Nation, Rockies LNG and Western LNG filed the initial project description for the Ksi Lisims LNG project with the B.C. and federal governments.
Ksi Lisims LNG is a proposed 12-million-tonne-per-year LNG project at Wil Milit on the northern tip of Pearse Island near the Nisga’a village of Gingolx.
In June, meanwhile, Pembina Pipeline Corporation announced it will become the Haisla Nation’s partner in the development of the proposed Cedar LNG project. 
Cedar LNG is a proposed floating LNG facility in Kitimat, B.C., within the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation in the Douglas Channel, one of the principal shipping routes on the B.C. coast.
 “Canada has become a leader in dealing with these projects and First Nations…,” Marion said, adding that “First Nations people have historically been exploited by energy development.”
At the same time, she noted, there’s been a shift in attitude towards LNG development by the U.S. government.
“The previous [Trump] administration was pro-energy development. We find ourselves in 2021 with a far different attitude [with President Biden].”
Messages by U.S. administration officials on LNG have been mixed.
John Kerry, the U.S.’s climate envoy, told the New Yorker this summer that natural gas was needed “for the moment” but was not “anything near a long-term solution, unless somebody discovers 100 per cent abatement.”
Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has said that U.S. LNG can play an important role in replacing dirtier coal, especially in Asia, while also pressing industry to reduce methane emissions associated with natural gas production.
Roadblocks have arisen, in the U.S., though, that didn’t exist even two years ago, Marion said.
As an example, she cited the proposed Alaska LNG project, to be constructed in Nikiski, an industrial town located on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula, southwest of Anchorage.
This summer, the U.S. federal Department of Energy under the Biden administration announced that it’s ordering a supplemental environmental review of that export project.
And earlier this year, Pembina paused development of its proposed Jordan Cove LNG export plant in Oregon, according to an appeals court filing. That project faced opposition from Indigenous groups, environmentalists and a coalition of residents on Oregon’s rural southern coast.
Jordan Cove’s backers emphasized that its position on the U.S. West Coast put it closer to fast-growing Asian markets than Gulf Coast terminals, which have to send LNG through the sometimes-congested Panama Canal.
Marion said Western Canada’s closer location to Asian markets, particularly Japan, makes it more attractive to LNG buyers.
Another advantage of Canada’s West Coast LNG projects is the ability to power facilities with renewable hydro, thereby reducing GHG emissions.
Marion noted, too, that gas liquefaction in cold climates is comparably easier than in warmer regions. Lower temperatures could save energy and therefore reduce GHG emissions. The average temperature in Kitimat, B.C., for instance, is much cooler (7 C) than the U.S. Gulf Coast (e.g., 22 C in Corpus Christi, Texas).
“Western Canada is in a really unique position to export LNG to Asia given its colder ambient temperature [in comparison] to especially the U.S. Gulf Coast,” she said. “You’ve also got significantly shorter shipping distances to Asia, which reduces the amount of energy required to even get there and the cost goes down. And finally, Canada’s partnerships with Indigenous people sets them above and beyond other countries as far as ESG.”
DOB reporter Paul Wells reported on a companion GeoConvention presentation, which outlined some of the environmental benefits of using Canadian LNG, as well as the opportunity for Indigenous ‘economic reconciliation.’

"NGIF Industry Grants Provides $72,000 In Funding For Natural Gas Expander Power Generation | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
NGIF Industry Grants, a division of NGIF Capital Corporation, is supporting the product development and testing activities of RadMax Technologies, Inc.’s patented “common rotary core” technology.
With $72,000 in approved funding, the project will help accelerate commercialization through proof-of-concept laboratory and field tests that will be conducted to validate performance, durability, and overall economic viability.
RadMax’s natural gas expander can capture kinetic and pressure-volume energy in pressure letdown applications and convert it to power. It uses streaming natural gas pressure differential to generate electricity or compressed air, either of which can be used to drive the valve actuator controllers.
The NGIF-funded RadMax Expander pilot project will demonstrate the economic feasibility and operational effectiveness of the unit as a means to reduce pneumatic controller and pump methane emissions at the wellhead and at gas pipeline pressure letdown stations.
RadMax Technologies, Inc. — a Spokane, Washington-based corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of REGI US, Inc. — is a research and development company in the business of designing, developing, and proving axial vane-type rotary power devices for civilian, commercial and government applications. They are focused on creating new, disruptive technologies that are more efficient, compact, and cost-effective than those currently available.

CEPA Releases Pipeline Performance Report | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) today released its 2021 performance report.
In 2020, there were 15 unplanned natural gas releases, none of which were significant. In 2020, there were four liquids incidents, one of which was significant. All 672 bbls released in the incidents were fully recovered.
“CEPA members carefully monitor for incidents across the 95,592-kilometre network of transmission pipelines. In 2020, there was one significant incident (566 barrels of oil were released, and all 566 barrels were recovered). No incident is acceptable and CEPA members are committed to reaching their goal of zero incidents,” stated the report.
“Canadian natural gas and oil continues to play a critical role in the energy mix now and as the world transitions to a low-carbon energy future. The 2021 performance report highlights CEPA members’ innovation and continuous improvement in creating a sustainable energy future for Canada,” said Chris Bloomer, president and chief executive officer of CEPA.
“Our member collaboration and partnerships are critical to the success of the industry and government in reaching our economic and environmental goals,” added Dean Liollio, board chair of CEPA and president of Plains Midstream Canada. “CEPA members are proud to showcase to Canadians what we are doing to enhance safety, protect the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

PennEast Becomes The Latest To Scuttle A Natural Gas Pipeline Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — PennEast Pipeline said on Monday it would stop developing a proposed pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey, the latest in a series of natural gas lines to run aground due to legal and regulatory challenges.
The project was one of several started in recent years to draw gas from the fast-growing Appalachian region, only to run into local or environmental opposition to more fossil-fuel infrastructure.
 Gas prices have surged in Europe and Asia due to rising demand and lack of supply, and that has boosted U.S. gas prices to seven-year highs.
In the United States, natural gas is used for power generation and heating more than any other fuel, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. With the cancellation of PennEast and other pipelines, the industry is becoming more concerned that additional production from the key Marcellus/Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia will become trapped in the basin.
PennEast was canceled, the company said, because it had not yet received all of its required permits, including a water quality certification in New Jersey. It was one of the last major pipeline projects in the works set to pull gas from the Marcellus/Utica formation, the biggest U.S. gas shale basin.
""The PennEast partners, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined further development of the project no longer is supported,"" PennEast said in an email, noting it ""has ceased all further development of the project.""
The surge in U.S. production in the past decade turned the country from a gas importer into one of the world's biggest exporters. The United States exports about 10 per cent of the gas it produces as LNG.
""The Marcellus/Utica was the growth engine of natural gas production for many years and that has slowed considerably the past two years,"" said Luke Jackson, manager North America natural gas at S&P Global Platts, noting the region was already constrained by a lack of pipelines.
U.S. natural gas prices are at a seven-year high, boosted by overseas demand for U.S. LNG exports. In other markets, gas prices are trading at record levels due to low storage in Europe and insatiable demand in Asia.
Other East Coast gas pipes held up by regulators and legal battles include Williams Cos. Inc.'s Northeast Supply Enhancement from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York, and Dominion Energy Inc.'s Atlantic Coast from West Virginia to Virginia and North Carolina. The latter was canceled in 2020.
PennEast decided to stop development even though the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled in its favour in a lawsuit allowing the line to seize state-owned or controlled land in New Jersey.
The 120-mile (193-km) pipe was designed to deliver 1.1 bcf/d of gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  
""The legal and regulatory roadblocks that led to the cancellation of the PennEast Pipeline — which would have been built with union labour — are putting energy affordability and reliability at risk in America,"" the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America said in a statement.
PennEast initially hoped to complete the project in 2019. As recently as August, PennEast said it still hoped to finish the first phase of the $1.2 billion pipe in Pennsylvania in 2022.
